<think>

Okay, I need to create a web game where a character can move left and right using the keyboard. Let me start by setting up the basic structure. The user provided an HTML template, so I'll use that.

First, the Player object needs position, size, speed. Let's define that. The player will start in the middle bottom. Let's set x to half the canvas width, y near the bottom, maybe 20px tall.

Next, handling keyboard events. I'll need keyState object to track which keys are pressed. Using keydown and keyup events to set the pressed status. Wait, but how to track direction? Maybe track left and right presses. Using a set like ['left', 'right'] to track active directions.

Then the game loop. The gameLoop function will handle updating and drawing. Update the player's velocity based on the keyState. If left is pressed, velocity is negative, right positive. But acceleration and deceleration? Maybe velocity changes over time towards desired direction, with friction.

Wait, the functional requirements include acceleration/deceleration. So instead of instant movement, the player accelerates when moving and slows down when not. That complicates things. Maybe velocity is adjusted each frame based on pressed keys and friction.

Hmm, to handle that, in the game loop, check the keyState each frame. If left or right is pressed, add acceleration in that direction, else apply friction to decelerate towards 0. But need to clamp the velocity? Or set a max speed.

Also, boundary checks. The player's x must not go beyond 0 or W - player.width. So after updating x, check if it's beyond and adjust.

Drawing: the player is a rectangle. If moving left, draw an eye on the left; right, on the right. When idle, center. Maybe a small circle as the eye. So in the draw function, check velocity direction or keyState to decide where to draw the eye.

Wait, for the eye position, maybe track the current facing direction. If velocity is left, draw eye on left, etc. But when velocity is 0, center.

Let me outline steps:

1. Define Player with x, y, width, height, velocityX, acceleration, maxSpeed, etc.

2. Initialize player at bottom center.

3. Key events: track left/right presses. Maybe store in keyState object { left: false, right: false }.

4. Game loop: each frame, check keyState, compute desired acceleration. Then, update velocity considering acceleration and friction. Apply velocity to x. Clamp x between boundaries.

5. Drawing: rectangle for body, circle for eye. Depending on direction, draw eye left/right/center.

Let me code step by step.

First, in the script section, after the boilerplate:

Define Player class or object. Let's go with object for simplicity.

const player = {
    x: W / 2,
    y: H - 30, // 20px tall? Wait, height: let's say height 20, so bottom at H - 20. Maybe start at H - 50 to leave space?

    width: 30,
    height: 20,
    velocityX: 0,
    acceleration: 0.5, // adjust per frame
    maxSpeed: 5,
    friction: 0.8 // friction factor? Or maybe deceleration is velocity *= friction each frame?

Wait, acceleration and friction can be approached with:

- When key pressed, apply acceleration in direction.
- When not, apply friction (velocity *= friction each frame)

Alternatively, velocity += acceleration each frame when key is pressed, then apply friction. Hmm, maybe better to split acceleration and friction.

Alternatively, the velocity is adjusted each frame:

if (left pressed) velocityX -= acceleration * delta?
Wait, using delta time? The user mentioned delta time for frame rate independence. Since gameLoop is called with timestamp, maybe compute delta.

Wait, the gameLoop function has timestamp parameter. Let's compute delta in milliseconds since last frame.

Wait, but in the boilerplate, the game loop is set up with requestAnimationFrame, which passes the current time. So delta can be calculated as (timestamp - previousTime) where previousTime is stored.

Wait, perhaps better to use delta time for movement to make it frame-rate independent.

Let me think:

Each frame, the movement is velocityX * delta (in seconds?) added to x. But velocity itself can be adjusted by acceleration and friction based on key presses.

Alternatively, the acceleration and friction can be applied over delta time.

Hmm, perhaps:

Each frame:

- Handle keyState to determine desired direction (left/right)

- Compute acceleration based on desired direction.

- Apply acceleration and friction to velocity.

Wait, maybe:

acceleration is a constant, like 0.3, when moving left or right. Friction is 0.9 per frame, so velocity *= friction each frame unless accelerating.

Alternatively, velocity is adjusted towards desired direction with acceleration, and friction to slow down when not.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a more concrete approach.

Let me structure the code step by step.

First, create the player object:

const player = {
    x: 400, // middle of 800px canvas
    y: 580, // near bottom, 20px height
    width: 40,
    height: 20,
    velocityX: 0,
    acceleration: 0.5,
    maxSpeed: 5,
    friction: 0.95 // to gradually slow down
};

Wait, maybe friction is a factor applied each frame to velocity, so velocity *= friction unless accelerating. So when not accelerating, velocity decreases towards 0.

Alternatively, when moving, subtract friction from velocity.

Hmm, perhaps better to compute acceleration and friction each frame.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

Each frame:

- Check keyState to see if left or right is pressed.

- Compute desired acceleration direction (left: -1, right: +1, none: 0)

- Compute acceleration value: desiredDirection * acceleration * delta (in seconds?)

Wait, delta time is in milliseconds, so convert to seconds.

delta = (timestamp - previousTime) / 1000;

Then, acceleration = accelerationValue * delta.

Wait, perhaps:

if left pressed:

accelerationX is acceleration * delta in negative direction.

Else if right pressed:

positive.

Else, maybe apply friction?

Wait, maybe the velocity is adjusted based on acceleration and friction.

Let me try to model the velocity:

velocityX += acceleration * direction (based on keys) - friction * velocityX.

Wait, perhaps:

Each frame:

if left pressed: direction = -1

if right pressed: direction = +1

if neither: direction = 0

Then, acceleration is applied in that direction:

velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta;

But then, to have friction, maybe add a deceleration proportional to velocity.

Alternatively, apply friction as a damping:

velocityX *= friction; // friction is like 0.9, so velocity decreases by 10% each frame.

Hmm, this could work.

Let me outline:

player.friction = 0.9; // each frame, velocity is multiplied by this, so it slows down

player.acceleration = 0.5;

So:

In each frame:

Check keyState for left/right.

Compute desired direction (left/right). Let's say direction is -1, +1, 0.

if (direction != 0) {

    // accelerate in that direction

    velocityX += direction * player.acceleration * delta;

}

// apply friction

velocityX *= player.friction;

Wait, but maybe the acceleration and friction are separate steps?

Alternatively, first apply acceleration based on direction, then apply friction.

Wait, but perhaps this is better:

velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta;

velocityX *= friction;

But then friction would need to be a factor <1, so that velocity reduces.

Wait, perhaps:

velocityX = (velocityX + acceleration * direction * delta) * friction;

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, separate acceleration and friction.

Velocity is updated as:

velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta;

But also, if no direction is pressed, apply friction.

Wait, maybe the friction is always applied, but when moving, acceleration is added.

Hmm, perhaps:

The friction could be a damping factor over time. Like, each frame:

velocityX *= (1 - friction * delta);

Wait, maybe:

friction = 0.1; // per second

delta is in seconds.

Then:

velocityX -= velocityX * friction * delta;

Which would model the velocity decreasing over time when no force is applied.

Hmm, that might be better.

Let me structure the code:

Player has:

acceleration: 0.5 (pixels per second per second?)

maxSpeed: 5;

friction: 0.1 (per second)

delta is calculated as (timestamp - previousTime)/1000.

Wait, perhaps the acceleration is a force, and velocity is adjusted towards desired direction, but with friction.

Alternatively, the code in game loop:

// Update velocity based on direction and acceleration

if (leftPressed) {

    desiredX = -acceleration;

} else if (rightPressed) {

    desiredX = acceleration;

} else {

    desiredX = 0;

}

Then, compute the acceleration towards desired direction, considering current velocity?

Hmm, perhaps the simplest approach is:

Each frame:

- Check keyState to see if left or right is pressed.

- Compute desired direction (left: -1, right: +1, else 0)

- Compute acceleration (direction * accelerationConstant * delta)

- Update velocity with that acceleration, but clamped to maxSpeed.

- Apply friction (velocity *= friction)

Wait, but I need to separate acceleration from friction.

Alternatively, the velocity is adjusted each frame based on:

velocityX += (desiredAcceleration - velocityX) * delta;

But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, here's a way:

The player has:

- acceleration (how fast they accelerate when moving)

- maxSpeed (maximum speed)

- friction (how much they decelerate when not moving)

In each frame:

direction is -1, 0, +1 based on keys.

if direction != 0:

    // accelerate towards desired direction

    let targetSpeed = direction * maxSpeed;

    velocityX += (targetSpeed - velocityX) * acceleration * delta;

else:

    // apply friction to slow down

    velocityX *= (1 - friction * delta);

Wait, that could work.

Alternatively, when moving, velocity increases towards maxSpeed in direction, and when not, it slows down.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the acceleration is a force that adds to velocity each frame when direction is pressed, and friction subtracts from it.

But I need to think of the variables:

player:

acceleration: the rate at which velocity changes when moving (e.g., 0.3 px per frame?)

maxSpeed: the maximum speed achievable.

friction: the rate of deceleration when not moving (e.g., 0.9 per frame, so velocity * 0.9 each frame).

Wait, perhaps:

Each frame:

if left or right is pressed:

    desired direction is -1 or +1.

    velocityX += direction * acceleration * delta;

    but clamp to maxSpeed.

else:

    velocityX *= friction; // to slow down over time.

Wait, but that approach:

- acceleration is added each frame when direction is pressed.

- when not pressed, friction is applied as a factor.

But this could work.

Let me proceed with that.

Now, the player's velocity is updated as:

const acceleration = 0.3; // per frame?

Wait, but with delta time, it should be scaled.

Wait, to make it frame-rate independent:

acceleration * delta (in seconds) * direction.

Wait, let me think:

acceleration is in px per second squared?

Wait, perhaps the acceleration is 0.2 (in some units) per second.

Wait, perhaps better to define acceleration as a value per second.

So:

In each frame:

delta is in seconds.

if direction is -1 (left):

    velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta;

else if direction is +1 (right):

    velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta;

else:

    // no acceleration, so velocity decreases due to friction?

Wait, perhaps friction is a damping factor applied every frame.

Alternatively, use a friction that's a force proportional to velocity, so velocity *= (1 - friction * delta).

But I need to combine acceleration and friction.

Alternatively, velocity is adjusted as:

velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta - friction * velocityX * delta;

Hmm, that would model a force causing acceleration and a friction force proportional to velocity.

But this might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively:

- When moving left/right, velocity is adjusted towards desired direction's max speed.

- When not, friction is applied.

Let me try to code step by step.

First, in the gameLoop function:

We need to compute delta.

We can track previousTime.

Wait, in the game loop:

function gameLoop(timestamp) {

    if (!previousTime) previousTime = timestamp;

    const delta = timestamp - previousTime;

    previousTime = timestamp;

    // rest of code.

}

Wait, but variables like previousTime need to be declared outside.

So, outside gameLoop:

let previousTime = 0;

Then, in gameLoop:

...

Now, inside gameLoop:

First, update player's velocity.

Check keyState to see direction.

const direction = 0;

if (keyState.left) direction = -1;

else if (keyState.right) direction = +1;

Then:

if (direction != 0) {

    // accelerate in that direction.

    const acceleration = 0.3; // px per second?

    const maxSpeed = 5; // px per second?

    // calculate desired acceleration delta.

    // velocityX += acceleration * direction * delta;

    // but need to not exceed maxSpeed.

    let targetSpeed = direction * maxSpeed;

    const deltaSeconds = delta / 1000;

    velocityX += (targetSpeed - velocityX) * acceleration * deltaSeconds;

    // clamp to maxSpeed?

    if (velocityX > maxSpeed) velocityX = maxSpeed;

    if (velocityX < -maxSpeed) velocityX = -maxSpeed;

} else {

    // apply friction.

    const friction = 0.9; // per second.

    velocityX *= (1 - (friction * (delta / 1000)));

}

Wait, maybe.

Alternatively, the code could be:

Let me define variables in player:

player.acceleration = 0.3; // per second

player.maxSpeed = 5; // pixels per second (so max acceleration over time).

player.friction = 0.9; // per second.

Then:

const deltaSeconds = delta / 1000;

if (direction != 0) {

    player.velocityX += (player.acceleration * direction) * deltaSeconds;

    // clamp

    if (Math.abs(player.velocityX) > player.maxSpeed) {

        player.velocityX = direction * player.maxSpeed;

    }

} else {

    player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * deltaSeconds));

}

Wait, but friction here is subtracted from velocity?

Hmm, perhaps friction is the damping factor.

Alternatively:

player.friction = 0.05; // per second.

player.velocityX -= player.friction * player.velocityX * deltaSeconds;

Wait, that would make velocity decrease towards zero over time.

Hmm, perhaps the code for velocity is:

player.velocityX += acceleration * direction * deltaSeconds;

// Apply friction when not moving:

// Wait, perhaps friction is always applied.

// Maybe:

player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * deltaSeconds));

// Also, when pressing a direction, the acceleration is added.

Wait, perhaps better to separate acceleration and friction.

Let me try:

acceleration is added when direction is pressed.

friction is always applied to slow down.

Wait, but maybe:

player.velocityX += (acceleration * direction - friction * player.velocityX) * delta;

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, here's a standard approach for acceleration and deceleration:

Each frame, if moving:

velocity increases towards desired direction (e.g., towards maxSpeed)

Otherwise, velocity decreases towards zero, with friction.

So:

if (direction != 0) {

    // desired speed is maxSpeed * direction.

    let targetSpeed = player.maxSpeed * direction;

    // compute acceleration towards targetSpeed.

    let deltaSpeed = (targetSpeed - player.velocityX) * player.acceleration * deltaSeconds;

    player.velocityX += deltaSpeed;

} else {

    // apply friction.

    player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * deltaSeconds));

}

But this is getting complex. Maybe set a simple example with constants.

Let me try to code with the following:

Player:

acceleration = 0.3 (pixels per second)

maxSpeed = 5 (pixels per second)

friction = 0.9 (per second)

Wait, perhaps:

In each frame:

delta in seconds.

if direction is pressed:

    desired acceleration: direction * acceleration

    velocity += acceleration * direction * delta;

    clamp to maxSpeed.

else:

    velocity *= (1 - friction * delta);

Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, just for simplicity, let's try without acceleration/friction for now, and handle the movement first.

Wait, perhaps the user's functional requirements include acceleration/deceleration, so I need to implement it.

Alternatively, let's proceed with the basic movement first, then add acceleration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to start with instant movement for left/right, then add acceleration.

Wait, but the functional requirements say to implement acceleration/deceleration, so I can't skip that.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed step by step.

First, create the Player object with variables:

const player = {

    x: 400,

    y: 580,

    width: 40,

    height: 20,

    velocityX: 0,

    acceleration: 0.5,

    maxSpeed: 5,

    friction: 0.9

};

Then, in the game loop, after getting delta:

Compute direction:

const direction = 0;

if (keyState.left) direction = -1;

else if (keyState.right) direction = 1;

Then, compute acceleration.

Wait, perhaps:

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration) * delta;

// clamp to maxSpeed

if (player.velocityX > player.maxSpeed) player.velocityX = player.maxSpeed;

else if (player.velocityX < -player.maxSpeed) player.velocityX = -player.maxSpeed;

// then, apply friction?

player.velocityX *= player.friction;

Wait, but this way, when direction is 0, velocity is reduced by friction.

But perhaps the friction should be a damping factor.

Alternatively:

player.velocityX *= player.friction;

// Then, if direction is pressed, add acceleration.

Wait, this would work if friction is e.g. 0.9, so velocity is reduced by 10% each frame.

But then, when direction is pressed, add acceleration.

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration) * delta;

But how to combine with friction?

Alternatively, first apply acceleration, then friction.

Hmm, perhaps the acceleration is added, then velocity is multiplied by friction.

Wait, perhaps:

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration) * delta;

player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * delta));

Wait, but then, if direction is pressed, acceleration adds to velocity, and friction subtracts some.

Wait, maybe the acceleration is a force that adds to velocity, and friction is a deceleration.

Alternatively, this is getting too stuck. Let's try to code without acceleration for now, then see.

Alternatively, let me code a basic movement first, then add acceleration.

Wait, but the user's functional requirements include acceleration/deceleration, so I need to implement it.

Hmm, perhaps the simplest way is to let the player have velocity that is clamped to a max speed, and when moving, velocity is set to +/- maxSpeed, and when not, velocity gradually reduces to zero via friction.

Wait, but that's not acceleration, just instant movement with damping.

Alternatively, using acceleration:

Each frame, if left pressed, velocityX increases by acceleration (e.g., 0.5 px per frame), until reaches maxSpeed.

Similarly for right.

Then, when not moving, velocity is reduced by friction (e.g., multiply by 0.9 per frame).

So:

acceleration = 0.5 (px per frame)

maxSpeed = 5 (px per frame)

friction = 0.9 (damp factor per frame)

So:

If left pressed:

if (velocityX > -maxSpeed) velocityX -= acceleration;

Else if right pressed:

if (velocityX < maxSpeed) velocityX += acceleration;

Else (no direction):

velocityX *= friction;

But this way, velocity approaches max speed when direction is held, and slows down when not.

This would work, but without delta time, it's dependent on frame rate.

To make it frame-independent, multiply acceleration by delta.

Wait, let me try with delta:

delta is in milliseconds.

acceleration per second: 0.5 per second

so acceleration per frame: 0.5 * (delta / 1000) per frame.

Hmm, so:

if (left pressed) {

    velocityX -= (player.acceleration * delta / 1000);

    if (velocityX < -player.maxSpeed) velocityX = -player.maxSpeed;

}

else if (right pressed) {

    velocityX += (player.acceleration * delta / 1000);

    if (velocityX > player.maxSpeed) velocityX = player.maxSpeed;

}

else {

    // apply friction.

    // perhaps velocity *= 0.9 per second.

    const frictionDecay = player.friction * (delta / 1000);

    velocityX *= frictionDecay;

}

Wait, but that may not work.

Alternatively:

friction is a damping factor, so every frame:

velocityX *= (1 - (friction * delta));

So, if friction is 0.05 (5% per second), then every frame:

deltaSeconds = delta / 1000.

velocityX *= (1 - (0.05 * deltaSeconds)).

Hmm, that reduces velocity over time.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be:

// compute acceleration

let accelerationDelta = 0;

if (keyState.left) {

    accelerationDelta = -player.acceleration;

} else if (keyState.right) {

    accelerationDelta = player.acceleration;

}

player.velocityX += accelerationDelta * delta;

// apply friction

player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * delta));

// clamp the velocity

player.velocityX = Math.max(Math.min(player.velocityX, player.maxSpeed), -player.maxSpeed);

Wait, that way, when direction is pressed, acceleration is added, then friction is applied.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this can work.

Now, moving the player's x based on velocity:

player.x += player.velocityX;

Then, clamp player.x to stay within boundaries.

player.x = Math.max(0, player.x);

player.x = Math.min(canvas.width - player.width, player.x);

But I need to code all this.

Let me proceed to outline the code step by step.

First, define keyState to track left/right presses.

const keyState = {

    left: false,

    right: false

};

Add event listeners for keydown and keyup.

document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {

    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft' || e.key === 'a') {

        keyState.left = true;

    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight' || e.key === 'd') {

        keyState.right = true;

    }

});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {

    if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft' || e.key === 'a') {

        keyState.left = false;

    } else if (e.key === 'ArrowRight' || e.key === 'd') {

        keyState.right = false;

    }

});

Wait, but what if both left and right are pressed? Probably, the last pressed direction takes precedence? Or ignore.

Hmm, but if both are pressed, it's conflicting, but perhaps we can treat it as no direction.

Alternatively, check if both are pressed and set direction to 0.

But maybe that's complicating.

In the game loop, compute direction:

let direction = 0;

if (keyState.left && !keyState.right) {

    direction = -1;

} else if (keyState.right && !keyState.left) {

    direction = 1;

}

Now, back to the player's velocity.

In the game loop:

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration) * (delta / 1000);

// apply friction.

player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * (delta / 1000)));

// clamp velocity between -maxSpeed and +maxSpeed.

player.velocityX = Math.max(Math.min(player.velocityX, player.maxSpeed), -player.maxSpeed);

Wait, but the acceleration and friction may need to be separate calculations.

Alternatively:

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration) * delta;

player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * delta);

Wait, but delta is in milliseconds, so delta / 1000 to get seconds.

Hmm, perhaps:

const deltaSeconds = delta / 1000;

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration) * deltaSeconds;

player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * deltaSeconds));

// clamp.

player.velocityX = Math.max( Math.min( player.velocityX, player.maxSpeed ), -player.maxSpeed );

Alternatively, the acceleration and friction can be combined:

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration - player.friction) * deltaSeconds;

Wait, but that might not be right.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to separate the acceleration from the friction.

Wait, perhaps acceleration is the force applied when direction is pressed.

Then, friction is always applied as a damping.

Alternatively, here's a possible formula:

player.velocityX += (direction * player.acceleration - player.friction * player.velocityX) * deltaSeconds;

But that would model acceleration towards direction * acceleration, and friction proportional to velocity.

Hmm, perhaps that's the way to go.

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating; maybe proceed with a simple approach.

Let me try to code step by step.

First, the Player object:

const player = {

    x: 400,

    y: 580,

    width: 40,

    height: 20,

    velocityX: 0,

    acceleration: 0.5,

    maxSpeed: 5,

    friction: 0.9 // damp factor per second

};

Then, in the game loop:

function gameLoop(timestamp) {

    let previousTime = 0;

    let delta = timestamp - previousTime;

    previousTime = timestamp;

    // but need to track previousTime outside the function.

    // Wait, let's declare previousTime outside.

    let previousTime = 0;

    // inside gameLoop:

    if (previousTime === 0) {

        previousTime = timestamp;

        delta = 0;

    } else {

        delta = timestamp - previousTime;

    }

    previousTime = timestamp;

    // rest of code.

    // compute delta in seconds.

    const deltaSeconds = delta / 1000;

    // compute direction.

    let direction = 0;

    if (keyState.left && !keyState.right) {

        direction = -1;

    } else if (keyState.right && !keyState.left) {

        direction = 1;

    }

    // Update velocity.

    if (direction != 0) {

        // Apply acceleration towards direction.

        const targetSpeed = direction * player.maxSpeed;

        // compute delta speed: towards targetSpeed.

        const deltaSpeed = (targetSpeed - player.velocityX) * player.acceleration * deltaSeconds;

        player.velocityX += deltaSpeed;

        // clamp velocity to not exceed maxSpeed in that direction.

        if (player.velocityX > player.maxSpeed) player.velocityX = player.maxSpeed;

        if (player.velocityX < -player.maxSpeed) player.velocityX = -player.maxSpeed;

    } else {

        // apply friction to slow down.

        player.velocityX *= (1 - (player.friction * deltaSeconds));

    }

    // clamp to maxSpeed

    player.velocityX = Math.max( Math.min( player.velocityX, player.maxSpeed ), -player.maxSpeed );

    // move player's x based on velocity.

    player.x += player.velocityX * deltaSeconds;

    // clamp x to boundaries.

    player.x = Math.max( player.x, 0 );

    player.x = Math.min( player.x, canvas.width - player.width );

    // draw player.

    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);

    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';

    ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, player.width,
 <!-- 797.06s -->
