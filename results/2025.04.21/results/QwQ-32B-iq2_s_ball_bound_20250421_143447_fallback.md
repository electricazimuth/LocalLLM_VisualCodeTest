Okay, let's tackle this bouncing balls simulation. First, I need to set up the HTML and Canvas properly using the provided boilerplate. Then, the main logic will be in JavaScript. 

Starting with the Ball class. Each ball needs position, velocity, radius, mass, and color. The mass can be proportional to radius squared, so I'll set that. The constructor should take parameters for these properties. 

Next, initializing the balls. I need to create at least 30, maybe up to 50+. They should have random positions and velocities, but avoid overlapping initially. To prevent initial overlaps, I might place them one by one, checking against existing balls for overlap. But since the problem says it's not a primary focus, maybe just randomize positions with some chance, but not perfect. 

The animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame. In each frame, clear the canvas, apply physics updates, then redraw. 

Gravity: Each frame, add a gravitational acceleration to the velocity. Let's say gravityValue is 0.3 or something. 

Wall collision detection: Check if a ball hits the edges. The container is the canvas itself. When a ball hits a wall, reverse the velocity component and apply damping. Damping factor like 0.8 or 0.9 to reduce energy. Also, correct position so it's not inside the wall. 

Ball-to-ball collision is trickier. The naive approach is O(n²), which is slow with 50+ balls. To optimize, maybe use a grid system (spatial partitioning). Divide the canvas into cells, and for each ball, check neighbors in nearby cells. 

Wait, but how to implement a grid? The grid can be a 2D array, where each cell contains a list of balls that are in that cell's area. Each frame, first update the grid based on current ball positions, then each ball checks collisions with others in the same or adjacent cells. This reduces the number of pairs to check.

Alternatively, a quadtree could be used, but a grid might be simpler for now. Let's go with a grid. Let me think: the grid size can be something like 100 cells per dimension? Or maybe a cell size larger than the maximum ball radius. 

Wait, the maximum ball radius is needed for grid cell size. Let's set the cell size to something like 50, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps set cell size as twice the maximum radius, so that if two balls are in the same cell, they might be close enough to collide. 

Hmm, perhaps the grid can be a 2D array where each cell is a square area. The balls are added to the cells they occupy. Then, for collision detection between balls, only those in the same or adjacent cells need to be considered. This way, instead of checking all pairs, we can check within a smaller subset. 

So, first, in the grid setup, each frame, create a grid based on current positions. For each ball, determine which grid cell they are in, and add them to that cell's list. Then, for collision detection, iterate over each cell and check the balls in that cell against each other, plus those in adjacent cells. 

But how to implement this in code? Let's think. 

First, define the grid size. Let's say each cell is 100x100. Wait, but maybe that's too big. Let me think of a grid that has, say, 10 cells per side. For an 800x600 canvas, each cell would be 80x60. Maybe that's okay, but maybe better to make cell size larger than the typical ball radius. Alternatively, compute cell size based on the maximum radius. 

Alternatively, let's decide on a cell size, say 100, and then calculate how many rows and columns that gives. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to let the grid be a 2D array where each cell's area is (canvasWidth / gridColumns) in x and (canvasHeight / gridRows) in y. 

Let me proceed step by step. 

First, in the code, after creating all the balls, I'll need to implement the grid. 

Wait, but maybe first, let's get the basic structure going. 

The Ball class will have properties: x, y, vx, vy, radius (r), mass (r*r maybe), and color. 

Then, in each frame's update step:

1. Apply gravity: vy += gravityValue. But considering mass? Wait, no, gravity accelerates all balls equally, so mass doesn't affect it? Wait, velocity is independent of mass in the acceleration phase, since F=ma, so acceleration a=F/m. But if we have a gravitational force, then gravity acceleration is F/m = (mg)/m = g, so mass doesn't matter. So maybe the mass is only for collision response. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, the mass can be proportional to radius squared. So perhaps each ball has a mass, and when colliding, momentum is conserved based on mass. 

So, in the collision response between two balls, we need to handle their masses. 

Okay, so the Ball class will have a mass property, which could be radius squared (since mass is proportional to radius squared if density is constant). Or maybe the user can choose, but the problem says "proportional to radius squared, or constant if preferred". Maybe pick mass as r*r. 

Now, back to the update steps:

After applying gravity, update velocity, then position. 

Wait, the process per frame:

- Update velocity (apply gravity and any other forces? Maybe not here)
- Update position (x += vx, y += vy)
- Then, check for collisions (walls and balls)
- Then, adjust velocities and positions based on collisions. 

Wait, but the order is important. After moving the ball, check for collisions, and then resolve them. 

Alternatively, during movement, check for collision and if so, stop and compute the response. 

Hmm, perhaps the better approach is to first compute the next position, then check for collisions. 

But in the code:

The main loop:

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
  // Clear canvas
  // Update all balls' positions and velocities first? 

  // First, apply gravity to velocities
  for each ball in balls:
    ball.vy += gravity

  // Update positions based on velocity:
  for each ball:
    ball.x += ball.vx
    ball.y += ball.vy

  // Then check collisions with walls and other balls

  // After moving, check wall collisions
  // Then check ball-ball collisions 

Wait, but the problem requires applying damping when bouncing off walls. 

So when a ball hits a wall, we need to reverse the velocity component, then apply damping. 

Wait, but the order here: after updating position, if the new position is outside the wall, we have to compute the reflection. 

Let me think of the steps:

After updating the position (x += vx, etc.), check if the new position is outside the walls. 

For example, for a ball's x position, if it's beyond the left wall (x - r < 0), then the ball has collided with the left wall. 

The response would be:

- Compute the reflection of the velocity's x component: vx = -vx * dampingFactor. 

- Then, correct the position so it's just touching the wall. 

But the problem says to "correct the position to ensure it's fully inside the boundary after the bounce". 

So, first, check if the new position is beyond the wall. 

Let me write this step:

For each ball, after updating the position, check four edges (left, right, top, bottom). 

For each edge, check if x - r < 0 (left), then handle it. 

Same for x + r > canvasWidth (right), y - r < 0 (top), y + r > canvasHeight (bottom). 

Once a collision is detected, reverse the velocity component (vx *= -1) and multiply by dampingFactor (e.g., 0.8), then correct position. 

Wait, but damping applies to the reversed velocity. 

So, when the ball hits the left wall, its vx would be negative (since it was moving left beyond the edge). But after collision, you reverse it, so the new vx is positive but multiplied by dampingFactor (so, say, 0.8). 

Also, correct the position so that the ball is at x = r (touching left wall). 

This way, the ball is inside the boundary after collision. 

Now, for ball-ball collisions. 

The naive approach is O(n²), which is slow. To optimize, spatial partitioning via grid. 

So, first, create a grid structure. 

Let me think of the grid as a 2D array. 

Let’s choose grid size based on cell size. 

Suppose cell size is 50 units. 

canvas is 800x600, so gridColumns = 800 / cellSize, gridRows = 600 / cellSize. 

But cell size needs to be such that cells are big enough to allow balls to potentially overlap with neighbors, but not too large that the grid doesn't help. 

Alternatively, cell size can be twice the maximum radius. Suppose the maximum radius is 20, then cell size is 40. 

But let's proceed with code. 

In the gameLoop function, after updating positions and velocities, but before collision handling, we can update the grid. 

Wait, perhaps:

Each frame:

1. Apply gravity to velocities. 

2. Update positions (x += vx, etc.)

3. Update the grid based on new positions.

4. Check wall collisions for each ball, apply damping and correct position. 

5. Check ball-ball collisions using grid-based pairs. 

Wait, but the grid needs to be updated before checking ball collisions, so that we can group balls in cells. 

Alternatively, during step 4, after checking wall collisions and correcting positions, then update the grid. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct flow is:

- Update velocities and positions. 

- Check wall collisions (and apply damping and position correction). 

- Then, update the grid based on the new positions. 

Wait, but the grid needs to be updated before checking ball collisions, so that we can find which balls are near each other. 

Alternatively, the grid can be built based on the current positions after step 2 (before checking collisions). 

But the problem is that the balls might have moved into a new position, so the grid must reflect their current positions. 

So steps:

After step 2 (positions updated), build the grid. 

The grid is a 2D array where each cell contains a list of balls in that cell. 

Each cell is (i,j) where i is the column and j the row. 

The cell size can be determined as cellSize = 50 (for example). 

To compute which cell a ball is in, given its center (x,y):

col = Math.floor(x / cellSize)

row = Math.floor(y / cellSize)

Then, we can add the ball to grid[col][row]. 

Once the grid is built, then we can check for collisions between balls in the same cell or adjacent cells. 

Wait, but even this may not capture all collisions, since two balls in adjacent cells might still collide. 

Alternatively, check the current cell and all adjacent cells (including diagonals). 

So, for each ball, we look at all cells in a 3x3 grid around their cell (current cell and 8 neighbors), and check collisions with those balls. 

This would cover all balls that are in nearby cells, which reduces the total number of pairs to check. 

This way, even if two balls are in adjacent cells, their centers might be within each other's radii, so we need to check them. 

This is a common optimization approach. 

So, the steps for ball-ball collision would be:

- Iterate over each ball (ballA):

- For each cell in the 3x3 grid around ballA's cell:

- Iterate over each ball in those cells (ballB):

- If ballA is not the same as ballB, compute distance between them. 

- If distance <= rA + rB, then there's a collision. 

- Then, resolve the collision. 

- To avoid checking duplicates (like checking ballA vs ballB and then ballB vs ballA), perhaps check for ballA < ballB (like using indices). 

Wait, but to prevent checking duplicates, maybe we can track which pairs have been checked. But with the grid approach, maybe it's manageable. 

Alternatively, when iterating over the cells, for each ball in the cell, check against balls in cells to the right and above, so that each pair is only checked once. 

Hmm, perhaps better to just proceed with checking all pairs but only once. 

Alternatively, when iterating through all pairs in the grid, but in a way that each pair is only considered once. 

But this might complicate. 

Alternatively, just check all pairs, but allow duplicates, but during collision response, use a flag to prevent double handling. 

Wait, but the main thing is to reduce the number of pairs to check. 

Let me outline the code steps for the grid:

First, define the grid structure. 

In the gameLoop, after updating positions and velocities, and checking walls:

Initialize the grid as an array of arrays. 

First, decide the cellSize. 

Then compute the number of columns and rows:

numColumns = Math.floor(W / cellSize) + 1;

numRows = Math.floor(H / cellSize) + 1;

Wait, but perhaps the cellSize can be a variable, like 50. 

Alternatively, in code:

const cellSize = 50; 

// later in gameLoop:

const grid = Array.from({length: numColumns}, () => new Array(numRows).fill(null));

Wait, but how to compute numColumns and numRows? 

Wait, the maximum x coordinate is W (800). 

numColumns = Math.floor(W / cellSize) + 1;

Wait, perhaps better to compute for each ball's position:

for each ball:

col = Math.floor(ball.x / cellSize)

row = Math.floor(ball.y / cellSize)

Then, if col is beyond the grid's current dimensions, the grid needs to be built with sufficient size. 

Hmm, perhaps the grid is built as a 2D array that's dimensioned to cover the entire canvas. 

Alternatively, compute the grid dimensions first:

numColumns = Math.ceil(W / cellSize);

numRows = Math.ceil(H / cellSize);

Then, initialize grid as an array of numColumns arrays, each of length numRows, each cell containing an array of balls in that cell. 

So, in code:

grid = new Array(numColumns);

for (let i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {

  grid[i] = new Array(numRows);

  for (let j = 0; j < numRows; j++) {

    grid[i][j] = [];

  }

}

Then, for each ball:

col = Math.floor(ball.x / cellSize)

row = Math.floor(ball.y / cellSize)

But if the ball is near the edge of the canvas, like ball.x is exactly W, then col would be Math.floor(800 / 50) = 16 (since 16 * 50 = 800). 

Wait, but 800 /50 is 16, so the cell for x=800 is 16, but if the grid is of size 16, then the indices go up to 15. 

Hmm, so perhaps cellSize should be 50, then W is 800, so 800/50=16 cells, so the grid is 16 columns and 12 rows (if cellSize is 50 for H). 

Wait, H is 600, 600/50=12 rows. 

So, for x=800 (ball.x =800), col would be 800/50 =16, which would be beyond the grid's column count (since it's 16 columns numbered 0-15). Wait no: 16 columns would have indices 0-15? No, 16 elements, so indices 0 to 15. 

Wait, no. If numColumns is Math.ceil(W / cellSize), so W=800, cellSize=50 → 16 cells exactly. So columns are 0-15. 

Wait, 16 columns would be numbered 0-15. 

So if a ball's x is 800, then x / cellSize = 16 → col=16, but that's beyond the grid's column count (since it's 0-15). 

Wait, so this suggests that the cellSize must be chosen such that it divides the canvas exactly. 

Alternatively, perhaps cellSize is chosen to be 800 / desiredColumns. 

But maybe this is getting too detailed. Let's proceed with code. 

In code:

const cellSize = 50; 

numColumns = Math.ceil(W / cellSize); // W is 800, so 16

numRows = Math.ceil(H / cellSize); // H 600 → 12 

Then, grid is an array of numColumns elements. 

grid = new Array(numColumns);

for (let i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {

  grid[i] = new Array(numRows);

  for (let j = 0; j < numRows; j++) {

    grid[i][j] = [];

  }

}

Then, for each ball:

let col = Math.floor(ball.x / cellSize);

let row = Math.floor(ball.y / cellSize);

But if ball.x is 800 (exactly), then 800 /50 =16 → Math.floor(16) is 16 → which is equal to numColumns (16). 

Wait, Math.floor(800/cellSize) =16 → but the grid has 16 columns (indices 0-15). So 16 exceeds the array. 

Therefore, we need to make sure that col is clamped to max of (numColumns-1). 

Wait, for example, when ball.x is 800, then (800 - (cellSize -1)) would be at 799, which is the last cell in column 15 (since 15*50=750, so 750 to 800 is column 15? Wait, no. Wait, 15 * cellSize = 15*50=750 → cell 15 is from 750 to 800 (since cellSize=50). 

Wait, perhaps the calculation is:

col = Math.floor( ball.x / cellSize );

The maximum x is W (800). So 800 /50 =16 → so col would be 16, but since the grid's columns are 0 to 15, that's invalid. 

Therefore, to prevent overflow, the column should be clamped to (numColumns -1) if necessary. 

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible x is W -1, so that when x is W, it's beyond. 

Alternatively, perhaps the cellSize should be set so that it divides the canvas exactly, but maybe it's better to adjust the cell size such that:

cellSize = W / desiredColumns → but desiredColumns could be 16, so cellSize = 50. 

Then, the maximum x is W (800), so 800 /50 =16, which would be col=16, but since numColumns is 16, the maximum column is 15 (since indices start at 0). 

Wait, no, in that case, the calculation would be off. 

Hmm, perhaps I need to recalculate the cellSize so that it exactly divides W and H. 

Alternatively, perhaps using 800 /16 =50 → so that W is exactly divided by cellSize. 

Therefore, the code for col and row must be:

col = Math.floor( (ball.x) / cellSize );

if (col >= numColumns) col = numColumns -1;

Similarly for row. 

Alternatively, maybe just take the minimum of col and numColumns-1. 

So:

col = Math.min( Math.floor(ball.x / cellSize), numColumns -1 );

row = Math.min( Math.floor(ball.y / cellSize), numRows -1 );

This way, even if ball.x is exactly at W, it will be clamped to the last cell. 

Okay, now, once the grid is built, then for each ball, we can check the nearby cells (current and adjacent cells) to find potential collision partners. 

The idea is to check all balls in the current cell and adjacent cells (within a 3x3 grid around the current cell). 

So for each ballA:

Loop over the nearby cells (i from col-1 to col+1, j from row-1 to row+1), but clamped to 0 <= i < numColumns and 0 <= j < numRows. 

For each cell in that range, iterate through the balls in that cell and check for collisions with ballA. 

To avoid checking the same pair twice, perhaps check ballA < ballB (using their indices in the array), so each pair is only considered once. 

Alternatively, for each ball in the current cell and adjacent cells, check if they are different from ballA, and then check collision. 

But this might result in checking ballA and ballB in the same cell, so they are considered twice (once in each other's vicinity). 

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to loop through all balls in the current cell and in the neighboring cells, and for each, check if it's a different ball and compute the distance. 

But the problem is that this could result in double checking (ballA and ballB both check each other). 

Alternatively, you can loop through the balls in a way that for each ballA, you only check balls that are after it in the list, so you don't repeat. 

Alternatively, to avoid double checking, when comparing ballA and ballB, only do so if ballB is after ballA in the array. 

Wait, but the balls are in an array, so we can loop through them in order. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's manageable to proceed without worrying about duplicates, since the collision response is symmetrical. 

The collision response between two balls is mutual, so even if both balls are processed, the response will still be correct. 

Wait, but in the collision response, when two balls collide, we need to compute their new velocities. 

Wait, perhaps the code can proceed like this: 

for each ball in the balls array:

    for each cell in nearby cells (3x3):

        for each ballB in that cell:

            if (ballA is ballB) continue;

            if (distance <= rA + rB) {

                // compute collision response

                // but to prevent double handling, perhaps flag them?

            }

But this will process each pair twice (ballA and ballB each have their own cells, so they may both be in each other's vicinity). 

Alternatively, perhaps only check cells where the current cell's index is <= to the other cell's index. 

Alternatively, it's okay to process each pair twice, but the collision response is symmetric. 

Wait, but the collision response between two balls should only be applied once. 

Alternatively, when a collision is detected between ballA and ballB, we can check if the ballA is before ballB in some ordering (like their indices), then process it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to process each pair once by ensuring that for each ballA, we check cells in a way that only includes cells with indices greater than or equal, but that's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, proceed, and when a collision is detected, mark that the pair has been processed. 

Wait, perhaps the code can use a flag array. 

Alternatively, when a collision is detected between ballA and ballB, process it, then ensure that the same pair isn't processed again. 

Alternatively, just proceed and let the response be applied twice, but since the response is symmetric, it might not matter. 

Wait, the collision between two balls is mutual. When two balls collide, their velocities need to be updated based on the collision. 

Suppose we have a pair (ballA, ballB). 

The correct way is to compute the impulse and update their velocities. 

If we process this pair twice, then the impulse would be applied twice, leading to incorrect results. 

Therefore, we need to process each pair once. 

Hmm. 

So, perhaps the following approach:

For each ballA in the balls array:

    for each cell in nearby cells (current cell and adjacent):

        for each ballB in the cell:

            if (ballB is before ballA in the array) → skip to avoid duplicates

            else:

                check if they are colliding. 

Alternatively, when iterating through the nearby cells, skip cells that are to the left or above the current cell's grid position? Not sure. 

Alternatively, to avoid processing the same pair twice, we can loop through the balls array and for each ballB in the cells, check if ballB is after ballA in the array. 

Wait, in code:

for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {

    let ballA = balls[i];

    // loop over nearby cells:

    // for each cell in 3x3 grid around ballA's cell:

    // iterate through balls in those cells:

    for (let j = 0; j < cellsBalls.length; j++) {

        let ballB = cellsBalls[j];

        // check if ballB is after ballA in the array (i.e., ballB is at index > i)

        if (ballB === ballA) continue; // skip same ball

        // compute distance

        if (distance <= rA + rB) {

            // process collision

            // mark as processed to prevent later when ballB is at i = ballB's index, etc.

            // but this might not work.

        }

    }

}

Alternatively, maybe the best way is to process each pair once by ensuring that for ballA and ballB, we process them only once, perhaps by checking if ballA is before ballB in the array. 

Alternatively, proceed without the spatial grid for now, but then with 50 balls, the O(n²) is 2500 pairs, which might be manageable. 

Wait, but with 50 balls, 50² is 2500, which is acceptable, but with 100 balls, it would be 10,000. 

The problem says "significant number, like 50+", so maybe the grid optimization is necessary for 50+. 

Alternatively, proceed with the grid-based approach, and then handle the duplicates via the flagging. 

Let me think of the code structure. 

First, in the gameLoop function:

After updating velocities and positions (step 1 and 2):

We need to first handle wall collisions. 

Wait, but after moving the balls, their positions may have gone beyond walls. 

So step 3: check wall collisions and apply damping and position correction. 

The wall collision code can be something like this:

for each ball in balls:

    const r = ball.r;

    let changed = false;

    // check left wall

    if (ball.x - r < 0) {

        ball.x = r; 

        ball.vx = -ball.vx * dampingFactor;

        changed = true;

    }

    else if (ball.x + r > W) {

        ball.x = W - r;

        ball.vx = -ball.vx * dampingFactor;

        changed = true;

    }

    // top wall

    if (ball.y - r < 0) {

        ball.y = r;

        ball.vy = -ball.vy * dampingFactor;

        changed = true;

    }

    else if (ball.y + r > H) {

        ball.y = H - r;

        ball.vy = -ball.vy * dampingFactor;

        changed = true;

    }

}

Wait, but there's a possibility that after correcting for one wall, another wall's correction is needed. 

Wait, for instance, if a ball is at the corner, it might hit both left and bottom walls. 

But the code above checks left/right first, then top/bottom. 

Wait, but in the code above, after checking left and right, the top and bottom are checked. 

If a ball is moved such that it's beyond both left and top walls, then correcting left first, then top. 

But perhaps it's okay. 

Alternatively, the code should check all four walls in any order, because if a ball is in a corner, it needs to be corrected for all applicable walls. 

Wait, but when you hit a corner, like left and top, you need to correct both x and y. 

The code above would first check left, correct x, then check top, correct y. 

But since the ball is near the corner, after correcting x to r, it might still be above the top wall (if y was too high). 

Wait, but in code above, after checking left and right, it checks top and bottom again. 

Wait, the code would first check left/right, then top/bottom. 

Wait, the first 'if (ball.x - r <0)' handles left wall. 

Then, else if for right wall. 

Then, after that, check top and bottom. 

But if the ball was near the left wall and also near the top wall, the code would first correct x to r, then check y. 

The y might still be too low (below 0?), so it corrects y to r. 

Okay, that works. 

But what if after correcting x, the y is okay but then the ball now hits the left wall again? 

Hmm, no, because the x is corrected to r, so it's now touching the left wall, but the velocity's x component is reversed with damping, so it should move away. 

But in the next frame, it might not hit again unless velocity brings it back. 

Okay, so the code is okay. 

Now, after handling walls, proceed to the grid-based ball collision detection. 

Let me outline the code steps again. 

First, build the grid: 

const cellSize = 50; 

numColumns = Math.ceil(W / cellSize); 

numRows = Math.ceil(H / cellSize); 

grid = new Array(numColumns); 

for (let i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {

  grid[i] = new Array(numRows); 

  for (let j = 0; j < numRows; j++) {

    grid[i][j] = []; 

  }

}

Then, for each ball in balls:

compute col and row:

col = Math.floor( ball.x / cellSize );

row = Math.floor( ball.y / cellSize ); 

clamp them to the maximum indices:

col = Math.min(col, numColumns -1); 

row = Math.min(row, numRows -1); 

then add the ball to grid[col][row]. 

Wait, but this is after the wall collision correction, so the ball's x and y are already corrected. 

Wait, but after applying wall collision, their positions are within the canvas. 

Okay, so building the grid after handling walls. 

Once the grid is built, then check the collisions. 

Now, iterate over each ball:

for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {

  const ballA = balls[i]; 

  const colA = Math.floor( ballA.x / cellSize ); 

  const rowA = Math.floor( ballA.y / cellSize ); 

  clamp them again? 

  let startX = Math.max(colA -1, 0); 

  let endX = Math.min(colA +1, numColumns-1);

Wait, but this is a lot of code. 

Alternatively, for a simplified collision response, perhaps when two balls collide, swap their velocities perpendicular to the collision normal? 

Hmm, but this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, use a simple reflection approach, where when two balls collide, their velocities are adjusted based on the collision normal. 

Alternatively, the code can compute the normal vector between the two balls, then adjust the velocities such that they move away from each other. 

Wait, but maybe I should look up the elastic collision formula. 

The elastic collision between two balls can be computed by exchanging velocities along the line connecting their centers. 

The formula is:

Let’s denote:

- vA and vB are the velocities of the two balls.

- The collision occurs along a direction perpendicular to the line connecting them (the normal). 

The relative velocity along the normal is:

v_rel = (vA - vB) · n, where n is the unit normal vector.

The impulse exchanged between them is:

J = ( (1 + dampingFactor) * (v_rel) ) / (1/massA + 1/massB)

Then, the velocities are updated as:

vA += (J / massA) * n

vB -= (J / massB) * n

Wait, but this is for an elastic collision with friction. 

Alternatively, the damping factor here would be part of the coefficient of restitution. 

The coefficient of restitution (e) is the ratio of velocities after collision to before. 

e = (v2' - v1') / (v1 - v2) 

For a perfectly elastic collision, e =1. 

In this problem, the damping factor (like 0.8) would be e. 

So, perhaps the formula for the impulse would be:

J = ( (1 + e) * (v_rel) ) / (1/massA + 1/massB)

Then, the velocities are adjusted accordingly. 

This is a bit involved, but manageable. 

Alternatively, since this is getting complex, perhaps we can use a simplified approach for the collision response, even if it's not perfectly accurate, as long as it prevents sticking and provides a plausible bounce. 

For example, when two balls collide:

- Compute the normal vector between their centers. 

- Calculate the velocity component along the normal for each ball. 

- Compute the relative velocity. 

- Then, adjust each ball's velocity perpendicular to the normal (so their velocities along the normal are reversed with a damping factor). 

Alternatively, here's a simple method:

When two balls collide:

- Compute the unit vector pointing from ballA to ballB: 

    let dx = ballB.x - ballA.x; 

    let dy = ballB.y - ballA.y; 

    let distance = Math.hypot(dx, dy); 

    let nx = dx / distance; 

    let ny = dy / distance; 

- Compute the velocities in the direction of the normal:

    let vA = (ballA.vx * nx + ballA.vy * ny); 

    let vB = (ballB.vx * nx + ballB.vy * ny); 

- The relative velocity along the normal is vA - vB. 

- The impulse is calculated using the masses and the desired coefficient of restitution (e):

    let e = 0.8; // damping factor 

    let impulse = (e * (vB - vA)) / ( (1 / massA) + (1 / massB) ); 

    // Wait, but the standard formula for elastic collision in 1D is 

    // v1' = ( (m1 - m2)v1 + 2m2 v2 ) / (m1 + m2) 

    // but in normal direction. 

    // Alternatively, perhaps this can be simplified to 

    // exchange velocities along the normal with damping 

    // so:

    // After collision, the velocities along the normal are reversed with damping 

    let vaNew = ballA.vx * (1
