I need to create a bouncing balls simulation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's start by breaking down the requirements.

First, the HTML setup is given, so I'll use that boilerplate. The main task is to implement the physics and rendering using the Canvas API.

For the balls, I'll create a Ball class with properties like position, velocity, radius, mass, and color. Each ball needs to be initialized with random positions and velocities, avoiding overlaps. But since perfect non-overlap isn't required, maybe just check a few nearby balls to prevent immediate collisions.

Next, the animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame. In each frame, I need to clear the canvas, apply gravity, update positions, handle collisions with walls and other balls, then redraw everything.

Gravity is easy: just add a constant to each ball's vy. For wall collisions, check if the ball's edge is beyond the canvas. If so, reverse the velocity component and apply damping. Also, adjust the position to keep the ball inside.

Ball-to-ball collisions are trickier. The naive O(nÂ²) approach is too slow for 50 balls. So I need an optimization. Spatial partitioning with a grid might help. Divide the canvas into cells and only check balls in the same or adjacent cells. That reduces the number of checks needed.

For collision response, calculate the distance between centers. If it's less than the sum of radii, compute the collision normal and adjust velocities using the conservation of momentum. I'll use the masses to determine the impulse, then update the velocities accordingly. Also, after collision, separate the balls to prevent sticking.

Now, structuring the code. The Ball class will handle its own properties. The world will manage all balls, handle updates, and detect collisions. The game loop will call the world's update and draw methods.

Testing each part step by step. First, create balls and render them. Then add gravity. Then wall collisions. Then optimize collision detection with a grid. Finally, implement the physics for ball collisions.

Potential issues: Performance with 50+ balls. The grid should help. Also, ensuring that the collision response doesn't cause balls to overlap too much. Maybe after resolving the collision, move the balls apart based on their radii.

I'll start coding the Ball class. Then the World class that holds all balls and handles physics. The grid for spatial partitioning in collision detection. Then the game loop setup.

In the World class's update method, handle gravity, then update positions. Then check wall collisions. Then check ball collisions using the grid. For each collision pair, resolve the collision using the physics formulas.

For drawing, loop through all balls and draw them as circles on the canvas.

Need to make sure the grid is properly sized. Maybe each cell is a certain size based on ball radii. When adding a ball to the grid, calculate its cell and update the grid's list.

In collision detection between balls, for each ball, check nearby cells and their balls. For each pair, calculate distance and resolve if needed.

Testing the code incrementally. Maybe start with a few balls to verify each part works before scaling up.

Finally, ensure the animation runs smoothly with requestAnimationFrame and that the performance is acceptable with 50+ balls.

This implementation includes:

1. **Ball Class**: Manages individual ball properties and movement
2. **World Class**: Manages the simulation world with:
   - Spatial partitioning grid for efficient collision detection
   - Gravity implementation
   - Wall collision detection and response
   - Ball-to-ball collision detection and resolution
3. **Optimizations**:
   - Spatial partitioning grid (40x40 cells)
   - Neighbor checking only in adjacent grid cells
   - Physically based collision response
   - Efficient grid updates between frames
4. **Physics Features**:
   - Gravity (0.3 pixels/frameÂ²)
   - Damping (0.9 factor on collisions)
   - Elastic collisions with momentum conservation
   - Position correction to prevent overlap

The simulation should run smoothly with 50+ balls on modern browsers. The spatial partitioning grid significantly reduces the number of collision checks needed, making the simulation efficient even with a large number of balls.

The note section explains the key features and optimizations used in the implementation. The balls have varying sizes and colors, and the simulation demonstrates realistic physics interactions while maintaining good performance.
