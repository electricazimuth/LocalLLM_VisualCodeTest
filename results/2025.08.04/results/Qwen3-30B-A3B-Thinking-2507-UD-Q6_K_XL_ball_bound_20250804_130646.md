We are going to create a bouncing balls simulation with at least 50 balls.
 We'll use a grid-based spatial partitioning for collision detection to optimize the O(n^2) problem.

 Steps:
 1. Define a Ball class to represent each ball.
 2. Initialize 50+ balls with random positions (ensuring they are inside the canvas and not overlapping initially as much as possible) and random velocities.
 3. Use a grid to partition the canvas for efficient collision detection between balls (only check balls in the same or adjacent grid cells).
 4. Implement gravity (a constant downward acceleration).
 5. Handle wall collisions with damping (so balls lose energy on bounce).
 6. Handle ball-to-ball collisions with a simple but effective response (using conservation of momentum for elastic collisions, but note: we'll use a simplified version that prevents sticking).

 Important: We must prevent balls from overlapping after collision.

 We'll set:
   gravity = 0.2
   damping (for walls) = 0.8
   damping (for ball collisions) = 0.9 (so they lose a bit of energy on collision)

 For ball-ball collision, we'll do:
   Let ball1 and ball2 collide.
   Calculate the normal vector (direction from ball1 to ball2) and the relative velocity.
   We'll compute the impulse and update the velocities accordingly.

 However, note: a full elastic collision in 2D is:
   Let m1, m2 be masses (we'll use area proportional to mass: m = r^2 * constant, but we can use r^2 as mass for simplicity).
   Let v1, v2 be velocities of ball1 and ball2.
   Let n = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1) normalized (the normal vector at collision).
   Let v_rel = (v2 - v1) dot n.
   If v_rel > 0, they are moving apart -> no collision (but we are checking for collision so we assume they are moving towards each other).
   The impulse magnitude: j = (-(1 + e) * v_rel) / (1/m1 + 1/m2)
   Then update:
        v1_new = v1 + j * n / m1
        v2_new = v2 - j * n / m2

 But note: we are using a damping factor (e) for the collision. We'll set e = 0.9 (so it's not perfectly elastic).

 However, for simplicity and to avoid complex math, we can use a common approximation:
   We'll compute the relative velocity along the normal, then reverse the component of the relative velocity in the normal direction (with a coefficient for damping) and then update the velocities.

 But note: the problem says "plausible" and "well-reasoned". We'll do a simple version that is common in games.

 Alternative (simpler and common in many demos):
   Let dx = x2 - x1, dy = y2 - y1
   Let dist = sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
   Let overlap = (r1 + r2) - dist
   We'll move the balls apart by half the overlap (to prevent sticking) but note: we are going to do the collision response and then adjust.

 However, the problem says: "prevent balls from significantly overlapping or sticking together after a collision".

 We'll do:
   Step 1: Check for collision (distance <= r1 + r2)
   Step 2: If collision, then:
        - Move the balls apart by the overlap (so that they are just touching) to prevent sticking.
        - Then compute the collision response.

 But note: we are updating positions and then checking collisions. We have to do the collision response in the same frame.

 However, the common approach is to:
   a) Update positions (without considering collisions) -> this might cause overlap.
   b) Then, for each collision, we correct the positions (by moving the balls apart) and then update the velocities.

 But note: we are updating the positions in the same frame. We'll do:

   For wall collisions: we update the position to be inside and then adjust velocity.

   For ball collisions: we first check for collision (after position update) and then:
        - Correct the positions (so they are not overlapping) by moving each ball along the normal by half the overlap.
        - Then update the velocities.

 However, note: if we update the positions after the collision, we might have to do multiple passes? But for simplicity, we'll do one pass.

 We'll structure the update as:

   1. Apply gravity and update positions (for all balls).
   2. Check for wall collisions and handle (with damping and position correction).
   3. Check for ball collisions (using grid) and handle:
        a. Correct the positions (to remove overlap) by moving each ball along the normal by half the overlap.
        b. Update the velocities (with the collision response).

 But note: correcting the positions might cause new overlaps? We'll do a single pass and hope that the overlap is small.

 However, the problem says "prevent sticking", so we must correct the positions.

 Implementation of ball collision:

   For each pair of balls that are colliding (we'll get from grid):
        let dx = ball2.x - ball1.x;
        let dy = ball2.y - ball1.y;
        let dist = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
        let overlap = (ball1.r + ball2.r) - dist;
        if (overlap > 0) {
            // Move the balls apart by half the overlap in the direction of the normal
            let nx = dx / dist;
            let ny = dy / dist;
            // Move ball1 away from ball2 by half the overlap
            ball1.x += nx * overlap * 0.5;
            ball1.y += ny * overlap * 0.5;
            // Move ball2 towards ball1 by half the overlap (so they are just touching)
            ball2.x -= nx * overlap * 0.5;
            ball2.y -= ny * overlap * 0.5;

            // Now update velocities: we'll use a simple elastic collision with damping (coefficient e=0.9)
            // Calculate the relative velocity in the normal direction
            let v1n = ball1.vx * nx + ball1.vy * ny;
            let v2n = ball2.vx * nx + ball2.vy * ny;
            let vn = v2n - v1n; // relative velocity in normal direction (we want to reverse the relative velocity with damping)

            // If they are moving towards each other (vn < 0) then we have a collision
            if (vn < 0) {
                // Compute the impulse magnitude (with damping coefficient e)
                let e = 0.9; // coefficient of restitution (damping for collision)
                let j = -(1 + e) * vn / (1/ball1.mass + 1/ball2.mass);
                // Update velocities
                ball1.vx += j * nx / ball1.mass;
                ball1.vy += j * ny / ball1.mass;
                ball2.vx -= j * nx / ball2.mass;
                ball2.vy -= j * ny / ball2.mass;
            }
        }

 However, note: the above velocity update uses the masses. We are using mass = r^2 (so area proportional to mass).

 But note: the above formula for j is for the impulse. We are using the standard formula.

 But note: the above formula for j is derived from the conservation of momentum and the coefficient of restitution.

 However, we must be cautious: the above calculation of j is for the magnitude of the impulse.

 But note: the above method might cause the balls to jitter if we do it in the same frame? We'll hope it's stable.

 We'll set:
   mass for a ball = r * r   (so proportional to area)

 Steps for the simulation:

   - Initialize the grid: we'll create a grid of cells. The cell size should be at least the maximum ball radius (so that a ball can be in one cell at most, but we'll use a cell size that is a bit larger than the max radius to avoid having to check too many cells). However, note: we have balls of varying sizes. We'll set the grid cell size to be the maximum radius (say 20) or a bit more? Actually, we can set it to 20 (since max radius we set to 20) but we'll let the grid cell size be 20.

   - We'll create a grid with:
        gridWidth = Math.ceil(W / cellSize);
        gridHeight = Math.ceil(H / cellSize);

   - Each cell is an array of balls.

   - When updating, we add each ball to the grid (by its current position) and then for each ball, we check the 3x3 grid around it (current cell and adjacent) for potential collisions.

   - We must avoid checking the same pair twice? We can do: for each ball, check the balls in the same cell and the next cells, but then we'll get each pair twice? Actually, we can skip the same ball and also skip the ball that we are checking against? But note: we are going to check for every pair in the 3x3. We'll do:

        For each ball in the grid:
            For each cell in the 3x3 neighborhood (including the current cell):
                For each ball in that cell (that is not the current ball):
                    Check collision between current ball and that ball.

        But note: this will check each pair twice (once for ball A and ball B, and then for ball B and ball A). We can avoid by only checking pairs where the index of the first ball is less than the second? But we are using a grid and the balls are not in an array by index. Alternatively, we can check and then skip if it's the same ball? But we are iterating by grid so we can't easily avoid the double check. However, the double check is acceptable because we are only doing it for the pairs that are in the same or adjacent cells, and the grid is efficient. And the collision response is symmetric so doing it twice would be bad. So we must avoid.

        How to avoid? We can do: when we are processing a ball, we only check the balls that are in the grid cells that we haven't processed? But that's complicated.

        Alternatively, we can do the grid and then when we find a collision, we do the response and then mark that we've handled the pair? But that's messy.

        Instead, we can do: when we update the grid, we don't need to avoid double checks because the collision response is symmetric and we are going to do the same calculation twice? Actually, no: the collision response for the pair (A,B) is the same regardless of the order. So if we do it twice, we would be applying the collision twice? That would be bad.

        Therefore, we must avoid processing the same pair twice.

        We can do: when we add a ball to the grid, we don't do anything to avoid duplicates. Then, when we iterate, we can skip if the other ball has a lower index? But we don't have an index in the grid.

        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: we'll create a list of all balls, and then for each ball i, we check balls j where j>i. But that would be O(n^2) again. So we don't want that.

        Instead, we'll use the grid and then when we check a ball against the grid, we'll only consider balls that are in the same or adjacent cells and that have a higher index? But we don't have an index.

        Another idea: we can store the ball's index in the grid. Then, when we are processing ball i, we only check balls j that have an index greater than i? But we don't have the index of the ball in the grid.

        Alternatively, we can avoid the double check by not doing the collision response twice. We can break the grid into a list of balls and then for each ball, we check the grid and then skip if the other ball is the same as the current one? But that doesn't avoid the double check.

        Actually, the common practice in grid-based collision is to check every pair in the grid and then do the collision response. But then the same pair is processed twice? So we would have to do:

            if (ball1.index < ball2.index) {
                // process collision
            }

        But we don't have an index. So we can assign an index when we create the balls.

        Let's do:

            We'll create an array of balls: `balls = []`
            When creating a ball, we set `ball.index = index` (the index in the array).

            Then, when we are processing a ball, we only process a collision with another ball if `ball1.index < ball2.index`.

        However, note: the grid is updated every frame, so we have to store the index in the grid.

        Steps:

          - Create an array `balls` and assign each ball an index (from 0 to n-1).
          - When adding a ball to the grid, we add the ball object (which has the index) to the grid cell.
          - Then, when iterating, for a ball `a` (with index i) and a ball `b` (with index j), we only process if i < j.

        This avoids double processing.

 Implementation:

   We'll create a grid as a 2D array of arrays.

   Steps for grid:

        const cellSize = 20; // we choose a cell size that is at least the max radius (we set max radius to 20, so 20 is safe)
        const grid = new Array(Math.ceil(W / cellSize));
        for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            grid[i] = new Array(Math.ceil(H / cellSize));
            for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                grid[i][j] = [];
            }
        }

        function addBallToGrid(ball) {
            const x = ball.x;
            const y = ball.y;
            const cellX = Math.floor(x / cellSize);
            const cellY = Math.floor(y / cellSize);
            if (cellX >= 0 && cellX < grid.length && cellY >= 0 && cellY < grid[0].length) {
                grid[cellX][cellY].push(ball);
            }
        }

        function clearGrid() {
            for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                    grid[i][j] = [];
                }
            }
        }

        function getBallsInGridRange(x, y, radius) {
            // We'll get the cells that the ball might be in (and adjacent for collision) but we are going to check the 3x3 around the cell of the ball.
            // Actually, we are going to use the grid to get the 3x3 neighborhood for the current ball's cell.
            // But for the collision detection, we'll do: for each ball, we get the cell it's in and then check the 3x3 around that cell.
        }

        However, note: we are going to update the grid every frame? Actually, we can update the grid at the beginning of the frame (after updating positions) and then do the collision detection.

        We'll do:

          Step 1: Clear the grid (or we can rebuild it every frame).
          Step 2: For each ball, add it to the grid (using its current position).
          Step 3: For each ball, get the 3x3 grid cells around its cell and check all balls in those cells (with index < current ball's index) for collisions.

        But note: the grid is built from the current positions (after gravity and wall collisions).

        However, we have to do wall collisions first? Actually, we do:

          - Update positions (with gravity)
          - Then handle wall collisions (which may change position and velocity) -> then we update the grid? But note: the wall collision correction moves the ball to be inside the boundary, so we should update the grid with the new position.

        So:

          Step 1: Apply gravity and update positions (without considering walls or other balls).
          Step 2: For each ball, check wall collisions and update (with damping and position correction for walls).
          Step 3: Clear the grid and add all balls to the grid (with their new positions after wall collision).
          Step 4: For each ball, check the 3x3 grid around its cell for collisions (with the condition that the other ball has a lower index) and handle the collision (position correction and velocity update).

        Why step 4 after wall collisions? Because the wall collision might have moved the ball to a new grid cell, so we need to have the grid updated with the wall-corrected positions.

        But note: the wall collision correction is done immediately and then we update the grid.

        However, the wall collision correction might cause the ball to be in a different grid cell? So we must update the grid after wall collisions.

        So the order:

          for (ball of balls) {
            // Apply gravity: vy += gravity
            // Update position: x += vx, y += vy
          }

          // Now handle wall collisions (for each ball)
          for (ball of balls) {
            if (ball.x - ball.r < 0) {
                ball.x = ball.r;
                ball.vx = -ball.vx * damping;
            } else if (ball.x + ball.r > W) {
                ball.x = W - ball.r;
                ball.vx = -ball.vx * damping;
            }
            if (ball.y - ball.r < 0) {
                ball.y = ball.r;
                ball.vy = -ball.vy * damping;
            } else if (ball.y + ball.r > H) {
                ball.y = H - ball.r;
                ball.vy = -ball.vy * damping;
            }
          }

          // Now clear grid and add all balls (with the updated positions after wall collision)
          clearGrid();
          for (ball of balls) {
            addBallToGrid(ball);
          }

          // Now handle ball-ball collisions
          for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
            const ball1 = balls[i];
            const cellX = Math.floor(ball1.x / cellSize);
            const cellY = Math.floor(ball1.y / cellSize);
            // Check the 3x3 grid around (cellX, cellY)
            for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
                for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
                    const nx = cellX + dx;
                    const ny = cellY + dy;
                    if (nx >= 0 && nx < grid.length && ny >= 0 && ny < grid[0].length) {
                        for (let j = 0; j < grid[nx][ny].length; j++) {
                            const ball2 = grid[nx][ny][j];
                            // Skip if it's the same ball or if the index of ball2 is not greater than ball1? Actually, we want to process only when i < index of ball2? But we don't have the index of ball2 in the grid.
                            // Instead, we'll skip if ball2 is the same as ball1? But we don't have a reference to the same ball? Actually, we are storing the same ball in the grid, but we are iterating over the grid and we might have the same ball? We don't want to compare a ball with itself.

                            // We'll skip if ball1 === ball2? But note: we are storing the same ball in the grid, and we are iterating over the grid that contains ball1. So when we are at the cell of ball1, we will see ball1 in the grid. So we skip if ball1 === ball2? But note: we are using the same array, so it's the same object.

                            // However, we have the condition: we only want to process pairs (i, j) with i < j (by the index in the balls array). But in the grid, we don't have the index. So we can't use the grid to enforce i<j.

                            // Alternative: we'll process the collision and then skip the rest? But we don't want to process the same pair twice.

                            // Instead, we'll do: when we are processing ball1 (index i), we only process collisions with ball2 that has an index greater than i. But we don't have the index of ball2 in the grid. So we must store the index in the grid? Or we can avoid by having the grid store the index? Actually, we can store the index in the grid.

                            // Let's change: when we add a ball to the grid, we store the index (or the ball object, but we can get the index from the ball? We don't have it stored in the ball). So we'll store the index.

                            // We'll change the grid to store the index of the ball (so we can compare indices).

                            // How about: we don't store the ball object in the grid, but we store the index? Then we can get the ball from the balls array.

                            // We'll do that.

                            // But note: we are already storing the ball object in the grid. We can also store the index? Actually, we don't need to because we can get the index from the balls array? But we don't have a mapping from ball to index.

                            // Instead, we'll store the index in the grid. When we add a ball to the grid, we push the index (not the ball) to the grid cell.

                            // So we'll change the grid to store indices.

                            // Let's refactor:

                            //   grid is a 2D array of arrays of indices.

                            //   When adding a ball: grid[cellX][cellY].push(ball.index);

                            //   Then, when we get a ball index from the grid, we can get the ball from balls[index].

                            //   Then, when processing, we have:
                            //        ball1 = balls[i]
                            //        ball2 = balls[j]   (where j is the index from the grid)

                            //   Then we check if i < j? But note: we are iterating over the grid for ball1 (which has index i). The grid might contain a ball with index j that is less than i? Then we skip.

                            //   So we do: if (j > i) { process collision }

                            //   But note: we are iterating over the grid for a fixed i (the current ball index). So we can skip if j <= i.

                            //   However, note: the grid might contain the same ball (i) and we are skipping because j==i? But we don't want to process the same ball.

                            //   So we skip if j == i? Actually, we don't have j==i because we are storing the index and the current ball is at index i, but we are adding the ball to the grid with its own index. So when we are at the cell of ball1, we will see ball1 (index i) in the grid. We skip if j==i? But we don't want to skip the same ball? Actually, we don't want to compare a ball with itself.

                            //   So we skip if j == i.

                            //   And we skip if j <= i? Actually, we want to process only when j>i. So we skip if j<=i.

                            //   Therefore, we'll skip if j <= i.

                            //   But note: the grid might have balls with index less than i? Then we skip them because we already processed the pair (j, i) when we were at ball j (with index j) and then we would have processed the pair (j, i) when j < i? But we are processing the grid for ball i (with index i) and we see a ball j that is less than i: we skip because j<=i (and j<i so j<=i). Then we never process the pair? Actually, we want to process the pair only once. We want to process when the current ball (i) is the one with the higher index? So we process when j>i.

                            //   Therefore, we only process when j>i.

                            //   So we'll skip if j <= i.

                            //   But note: we are iterating over the grid for ball i, and we see a ball j. We skip if j<=i, so we only process when j>i.

                            //   This ensures each pair is processed exactly once (when the ball with the higher index is being processed).

                            //   So we'll do:

                            //        if (j > i) {
                            //            process collision between balls[i] and balls[j]
                            //        }

                            //   But note: the grid might not have the ball j in the 3x3? Actually, we are checking the 3x3 around the current ball's cell, so if the ball j is in the 3x3, we get it.

                            //   However, note: the grid is built from the current positions, so if the ball j is in the 3x3, we get it.

                            //   So we'll change the grid to store indices.

          }

        Therefore, we will:

          - Store the index of the ball in the grid (not the ball object).

        Steps:

          // Initialize grid to store indices
          const grid = new Array(Math.ceil(W / cellSize));
          for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
              grid[i] = new Array(Math.ceil(H / cellSize));
              for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                  grid[i][j] = [];
              }
          }

          function addBallToGrid(ball) {
              const x = ball.x;
              const y = ball.y;
              const cellX = Math.floor(x / cellSize);
              const cellY = Math.floor(y / cellSize);
              if (cellX >= 0 && cellX < grid.length && cellY >= 0 && cellY < grid[0].length) {
                  grid[cellX][cellY].push(ball.index);
              }
          }

          // Clear grid: we'll set each cell to empty array.
          function clearGrid() {
              for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
                  for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                      grid[i][j] = [];
                  }
              }
          }

          // Then, in the collision detection loop for ball i (with index i):
          for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
              const ball1 = balls[i];
              const cellX = Math.floor(ball1.x / cellSize);
              const cellY = Math.floor(ball1.y / cellSize);
              for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
                  for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
                      const nx = cellX + dx;
                      const ny = cellY + dy;
                      if (nx >= 0 && nx < grid.length && ny >= 0 && ny < grid[0].length) {
                          for (let k = 0; k < grid[nx][ny].length; k++) {
                              const j = grid[nx][ny][k]; // j is the index of the other ball
                              if (j > i) { // only process if j>i to avoid double processing and self
                                  const ball2 = balls[j];
                                  // Now check collision between ball1 and ball2
                                  // ... collision response code ...
                              }
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }

        This will work.

 7. We'll set the maximum radius to 20 (so that the grid cell size of 20 is safe). We'll generate balls with random radii between 5 and 20.

 8. We'll also set the initial velocities to be random (but not too large) so that the balls don't fly out too fast.

 9. We'll set damping for walls to 0.8 (so 20% energy loss on wall bounce).

 10. We'll set the coefficient of restitution for ball collisions to 0.9.

 11. We'll create 50 balls.

 Implementation details:

   - We'll create a Ball class.

   - We'll set the mass = r * r (so proportional to area).

   - We'll generate the balls with random positions (ensuring they are not too close to the walls initially: at least r away from the wall) and random velocities (with a magnitude between 1 and 5).

   - We'll avoid initial overlaps by checking? But it's hard with 50 balls. We'll do a simple loop: for each new ball, check against all existing balls to see if it's too close (distance < r1 + r2). If so, reposition. But note: we are generating 50 balls, so we do:

        let balls = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
            let r = Math.random() * 15 + 5; // between 5 and 20
            let x, y;
            let valid = false;
            while (!valid) {
                x = Math.random() * (W - 2*r) + r;
                y = Math.random() * (H - 2*r) + r;
                valid = true;
                for (let j = 0; j < balls.length; j++) {
                    let dx = x - balls[j].x;
                    let dy = y - balls[j].y;
                    if (Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy) < r + balls[j].r) {
                        valid = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            let vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10; // between -5 and 5
            let vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
            balls.push(new Ball(x, y, vx, vy, r, `hsl(${Math.random()*360}, 70%, 50%)`));
        }

     But note: the above might take a while for 50 balls. We'll hope it's acceptable.

     Alternatively, we can skip the initial overlap check and just let them overlap initially? The problem says "attempt to prevent", so we'll do the above.

 12. We'll set gravity = 0.2.

 13. We'll set the damping for walls = 0.8.

 14. We'll set the restitution for ball collisions = 0.9.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Note: We must clear the canvas at the beginning of the frame.

 We'll structure the gameLoop:

   function gameLoop(timestamp) {
        // Clear canvas
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);

        // Apply gravity and update positions
        for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
            balls[i].vy += gravity;
            balls[i].x += balls[i].vx;
            balls[i].y += balls[i].vy;
        }

        // Wall collisions
        for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
            const ball = balls[i];
            if (ball.x - ball.r < 0) {
                ball.x = ball.r;
                ball.vx = -ball.vx * damping;
            } else if (ball.x + ball.r > W) {
                ball.x = W - ball.r;
                ball.vx = -ball.vx * damping;
            }
            if (ball.y - ball.r < 0) {
                ball.y = ball.r;
                ball.vy = -ball.vy * damping;
            } else if (ball.y + ball.r > H) {
                ball.y = H - 1;

          }
