<think>Okay, let's tackle this Vehicle Collision & Restart Simulation. The goal is to create a simulation where vehicles move around a canvas, wrap around edges, collide with explosion effects, and then restart. I need to make sure all the requirements are met using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Canvas API.

First, I'll start by setting up the canvas and the basic structure. The HTML boilerplate is provided, so I'll use that. The canvas is 512x512, which is a good size. The styles are already there, so I can focus on the JavaScript.

Next, the main components are the Vehicle and ExplosionParticle classes. For the Vehicle, I need position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), size (maybe width and height for a rectangular car, and radius for collision detection), and an active state. The visual representation could be a rectangle for the car body and circles for wheels. But to keep it simple, maybe just a rectangle and circles for wheels that move. But collision detection might be easier with a circle (radius) since checking distance between centers is straightforward. So perhaps each vehicle is a circle for collision purposes but drawn as a car shape.

Wait, the problem says "simple visual representation of a car or truck using simple rectangles and circles for wheels." So maybe the vehicle is a rectangle with some circles for wheels. But for collision detection, using a bounding box or a circle. Since collision detection needs to be efficient, maybe using a circle (radius) for each vehicle. That way, collision is when the distance between two centers is less than the sum of their radii. That's easier than checking rectangle-rectangle intersections, which can be more complex.

So each Vehicle will have a radius for collision, but when drawing, it's a car shape. Let's go with that.

Then, the ExplosionParticle class. Each particle has position, velocity, lifespan, size, color. They should move outward from the collision point, have a lifespan that decreases over time, and fade out as they expire.

The simulation state needs to be managed: RUNNING, EXPLODING, RESTARTING. When in RUNNING, update and draw vehicles, check for collisions. If a collision is detected, switch to EXPLODING. In EXPLODING, create explosion particles, update and draw them, and once all particles are gone, switch to RESTARTING. Then, in RESTARTING, reset everything and go back to RUNNING.

For the animation loop, use requestAnimationFrame, and track delta time for smooth movement. The loop should check the current state and update/draw accordingly.

Collision detection between vehicles: need to check all pairs, but avoid checking the same pair twice. So for each vehicle, check against all subsequent vehicles in the array. If two vehicles are active and their distance is less than the sum of their radii, collision occurs.

When a collision happens, mark the involved vehicles as inactive (or remove them from the array), calculate the collision point (average of their positions?), then create explosion particles. Also, display "BOOM" text that expands and fades.

For the explosion particles, generate a bunch of particles with random velocities outward. Each particle has a lifespan that decreases each frame. When lifespan reaches zero, they are removed. They might also change color or opacity as they age.

The simulation needs to wait for a few seconds after the explosion particles are gone before restarting. So in the EXPLODING state, after all particles are gone, transition to RESTARTING, which then resets the vehicles and switches back to RUNNING.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Setup canvas and context.
2. Define classes for Vehicle and ExplosionParticle.
3. Initialize vehicles with random positions and velocities.
4. Animation loop with delta time.
5. State management: handle updates and draws based on state.
6. Movement and wrapping: when a vehicle goes off the canvas, wrap it to the opposite side.
7. Collision detection: check all active vehicle pairs.
8. Explosion effect: create particles, draw "BOOM", manage their lifecycle.
9. Restart the simulation after explosion.

Potential issues to consider:

- Delta time handling: since the animation loop may run at variable speeds, using delta time ensures consistent movement.
- Efficient collision checks: with many vehicles, checking all pairs could be O(n^2), but with 5-10 vehicles, it's manageable.
- Particle cleanup: need to remove particles when their lifespan is up to avoid memory leaks.
- State transitions: ensuring that the simulation correctly moves from one state to another without getting stuck.

Let's start coding.

First, the canvas setup:

const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

Then, the simulation state:

let simulationState = 'RUNNING'; // Possible states: 'RUNNING', 'EXPLODING', 'RESTARTING'

Vehicle class:

class Vehicle {
    constructor(x, y, vx, vy, radius, color) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = vx;
        this.vy = vy;
        this.radius = radius;
        this.color = color;
        this.isActive = true;
    }

    // Method to update position based on delta time
    update(dt) {
        this.x += this.vx * dt;
        this.y += this.vy * dt;

        // Wrapping around the canvas
        if (this.x - this.radius < 0) {
            this.x = canvas.width - this.radius;
        } else if (this.x + this.radius > canvas.width) {
            this.x = this.radius;
        }

        if (this.y - this.radius < 0) {
            this.y = canvas.height - this.radius;
        } else if (this.y + this.radius > canvas.height) {
            this.y = this.radius;
        }
    }

    // Draw the vehicle as a car shape
    draw(ctx) {
        // Car body
        ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
        ctx.fillRect(this.x - 10, this.y - 5, 20, 10);

        // Wheels
        ctx.fillStyle = '#000';
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(this.x - 8, this.y + 3, 3, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        ctx.fill();
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(this.x + 8, this.y + 3, 3, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        ctx.fill();
    }
}

Wait, but the collision is based on the radius. So the radius should be the distance from the center to the furthest point of the vehicle. For the car as drawn, the body is 20 wide and 10 tall. The wheels are at y+3 with radius 3. So the maximum distance from the center (x, y) would be sqrt((10)^2 + (5+3)^2) ? Wait, maybe the radius is set to cover the entire vehicle. For simplicity, perhaps set the radius to 15 (since the car is 20 wide, so half is 10, plus wheels which add 3, so total radius 13? Maybe just set it to 15 for safety. But this might lead to collisions being detected a bit early. Alternatively, compute the actual bounding circle. Alternatively, use a smaller radius for collision detection. This could be a point of adjustment.

Alternatively, use axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection. But for simplicity, let's stick with circle collision, and set the radius appropriately. Let's say each vehicle has a radius of 15. Then, during collision check, if the distance between two vehicles' centers is less than 15 + 15 = 30, they collide.

But the visual representation might have the car as a rectangle, so the actual collision area is larger. But for the sake of the simulation, perhaps using a circle is acceptable.

ExplosionParticle class:

class ExplosionParticle {
    constructor(x, y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 4; // Random velocity between -2 and 2
        this.vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 4;
        this.lifespan = 1.0; // In seconds
        this.remainingLife = this.lifespan;
        this.size = 3 + Math.random() * 3; // Random size between 3 and 6
        this.color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 70%)`; // Random color
    }

    update(dt) {
        this.x += this.vx * dt;
        this.y += this.vy * dt;
        this.remainingLife -= dt;
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        ctx.fill();
    }
}

Then, the arrays to hold vehicles and particles:

let vehicles = [];
let explosionParticles = [];

Initialization function:

function init() {
    vehicles = [];
    explosionParticles = [];
    simulationState = 'RUNNING';

    const numVehicles = 8; // Adjust as needed
    for (let i = 0; i < numVehicles; i++) {
        const radius = 15;
        const x = Math.random() * canvas.width;
        const y = Math.random() * canvas.height;
        const vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2; // Between -1 and 1
        const vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2;
        const color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 50%)`;
        vehicles.push(new Vehicle(x, y, vx, vy, radius, color));
    }
}

Then, the animation loop:

let lastTime = 0;

function animate(timestamp) {
    let dt = (timestamp - lastTime) / 1000; // Convert to seconds
    lastTime = timestamp;

    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    switch (simulationState) {
        case 'RUNNING':
            updateVehicles(dt);
            checkCollisions();
            drawVehicles();
            break;
        case 'EXPLODING':
            updateParticles(dt);
            drawParticles();
            checkExplosionEnd();
            break;
        case 'RESTARTING':
            // Wait a bit before restarting
            setTimeout(() => {
                init();
                simulationState = 'RUNNING';
            }, 2000); // 2 seconds delay
            break;
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

function updateVehicles(dt) {
    for (const vehicle of vehicles) {
        if (vehicle.isActive) {
            vehicle.update(dt);
        }
    }
}

function drawVehicles() {
    for (const vehicle of vehicles) {
        if (vehicle.isActive) {
            vehicle.draw(ctx);
        }
    }
}

function checkCollisions() {
    for (let i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++) {
        const v1 = vehicles[i];
        if (!v1.isActive) continue;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < vehicles.length; j++) {
            const v2 = vehicles[j];
            if (!v2.isActive) continue;

            const dx = v1.x - v2.x;
            const dy = v1.y - v2.y;
            const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
            const collisionDistance = v1.radius + v2.radius;

            if (distance < collisionDistance) {
                handleCollision(v1, v2);
            }
        }
    }
}

function handleCollision(v1, v2) {
    // Mark vehicles as inactive
    v1.isActive = false;
    v2.isActive = false;

    // Calculate collision point (average of their positions)
    const centerX = (v1.x + v2.x) / 2;
    const centerY = (v1.y + v2.y) / 2;

    // Create explosion particles
    for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
        explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(centerX, centerY));
    }

    // Draw "BOOM" text
    ctx.font = '48px Arial';
    ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
    ctx.fillText('BOOM', centerX - 24, centerY + 24);

    // Switch to exploding state
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';

    // Also, perhaps add a timeout to restart, but according to the requirements, wait for particles to expire
    // So in the EXPLODING state, we check when all particles are gone
}

function updateParticles(dt) {
    for (let i = explosionParticles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        explosionParticles[i].update(dt);
        if (explosionParticles[i].remainingLife <= 0) {
            explosionParticles.splice(i, 1);
        }
    }
}

function drawParticles() {
    for (const particle of explosionParticles) {
        particle.draw(ctx);
    }
}

function checkExplosionEnd() {
    if (explosionParticles.length === 0) {
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}

But wait, in the EXPLODING state, after the particles are all gone, we switch to RESTARTING, which then waits 2 seconds before restarting. However, the RESTARTING state is handled in the animate function's switch case. So when the state is RESTARTING, we set a timeout to reset and switch back to RUNNING.

But in the current setup, when the state is RESTARTING, the code in the animate function's case 'RESTARTING' will set a timeout. However, during that time, the animation loop is still running. So during the 2-second delay, the canvas might be empty. But the requirement says to wait 3-5 seconds before restarting. So maybe adjust the timeout to 3000-5000 ms.

But the code in the RESTARTING case uses setTimeout, which is asynchronous. However, the animate function will continue to run, and in the next frames, the state is still RESTARTING, so the code in the switch case will run again. Wait, that's a problem. Because every time the animate function is called while in RESTARTING state, it will trigger the setTimeout again, leading to multiple timeouts. That's not good.

So how to handle the RESTARTING state correctly?

Perhaps, when entering RESTARTING state, immediately perform the reset, but with a delay. But how to manage that.

Alternative approach: when the explosion particles are all gone, switch to RESTARTING. Then, in the RESTARTING state, after a delay, reset and switch back to RUNNING.

But the problem is that the animate function's loop is continuous. So in the RESTARTING case, we need to start a timer once, not every frame.

So perhaps, when entering RESTARTING state, set a flag to indicate that the restart is pending, and in the animate function, when in RESTARTING, check if the timer has been started, and if not, start it.

Alternatively, use a variable to track whether the restart timer is active.

Alternatively, in the checkExplosionEnd function, when switching to RESTARTING, immediately start a timer to restart after a delay. But since checkExplosionEnd is called during the animate loop, perhaps the timer can be set there.

But how to handle that. Let's think:

When explosionParticles are all gone, set simulationState to 'RESTARTING'. Then, in the animate function's switch case for 'RESTARTING', we need to wait for a delay before restarting.

But the animate function is called every frame. So during the RESTARTING state, each frame would trigger the code in the case. But we only want to start the timer once.

So perhaps, when entering the RESTARTING state, we set a variable like restartTimeoutId, and check if it's already set.

Alternatively, when the state changes to RESTARTING, set a timeout. But since the state transition happens in checkExplosionEnd, which is called during the animate loop, we can set the timeout there.

Wait, checkExplosionEnd is called in the animate function when the state is EXPLODING. So when explosionParticles are empty, simulationState is set to 'RESTARTING'. Then, the next time animate is called, it will enter the 'RESTARTING' case.

In that case, the code in the 'RESTARTING' case would be:

case 'RESTARTING':
    setTimeout(() => {
        init();
        simulationState = 'RUNNING';
    }, 2000);
    break;

But this would set a timeout every time the animate function runs while in RESTARTING state. That's not good. Because the animate function is called every frame (about 60 times per second), so the setTimeout would be called multiple times, leading to multiple resets.

To prevent that, we need to ensure that the timeout is set only once when entering the RESTARTING state.

So perhaps, when the state transitions to RESTARTING, we set the timeout. But how to detect the state change.

Alternatively, use a flag to check if the timeout has been set.

let restartTimer = null;

Then, in the 'RESTARTING' case:

case 'RESTARTING':
    if (!restartTimer) {
        restartTimer = setTimeout(() => {
            init();
            simulationState = 'RUNNING';
            restartTimer = null;
        }, 3000); // 3 seconds delay
    }
    break;

This way, the timeout is set only once when entering the RESTARTING state.

But how to handle the flag. The restartTimer variable needs to be declared outside the animate function.

So adding:

let restartTimer = null;

Then, in the animate function's switch case for 'RESTARTING':

case 'RESTARTING':
    if (!restartTimer) {
        restartTimer = setTimeout(() => {
            init();
            simulationState = 'RUNNING';
            restartTimer = null;
        }, 3000);
    }
    break;

This should set the timer once when entering RESTARTING state.

Another thing: when the simulation restarts, the vehicles are reinitialized with new positions and velocities.

Now, the "BOOM" text is drawn in handleCollision, but that's done once. However, in the current code, the 'BOOM' text is drawn immediately when the collision is detected. But during the EXPLODING state, the particles are drawn, but the 'BOOM' text is only drawn once. So it might not be visible for long. To make it more visible, perhaps the 'BOOM' text should be drawn every frame during the explosion, expanding and fading.

But according to the requirements, the explosion effect should include "BOOM" text maybe expanding at the viewer. So perhaps during the explosion phase, the text is drawn with increasing size and decreasing opacity.

But in the current code, the 'BOOM' is drawn once in handleCollision, which is during the collision detection in the RUNNING state. But when the state transitions to EXPLODING, the next frames are in EXPLODING state, and the 'BOOM' text isn't drawn again.

So this approach won't work. The 'BOOM' text needs to be drawn during the explosion phase.

Alternative approach: during the EXPLODING state, in addition to drawing particles, also draw the 'BOOM' text with some animation.

So perhaps, in the handleCollision function, store the collision point and the time when the explosion started, then during the EXPLODING state, draw the 'BOOM' text with expanding size and fading color.

But how to track that. Maybe add variables for explosionStartTime and explosionCenter.

Alternatively, during the EXPLODING state, the 'BOOM' text is drawn with increasing size and decreasing opacity for a few seconds.

But how to implement that. Let's think:

In handleCollision, when the collision occurs, store the collision center and the start time. Then, during the EXPLODING state, calculate the elapsed time since the explosion started, and adjust the text's size and opacity accordingly.

So variables:

let explosionCenter = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let explosionStartTime = 0;

In handleCollision:

explosionCenter = { x: centerX, y: centerY };
explosionStartTime = performance.now();

Then, in the drawParticles function (or in a separate drawExplosionText function), during the EXPLODING state, draw the 'BOOM' text with size increasing over time and opacity decreasing.

But how to integrate this into the existing code.

Modify the drawParticles function to also draw the 'BOOM' text:

function drawParticles() {
    // Draw explosion particles
    for (const particle of explosionParticles) {
        particle.draw(ctx);
    }

    // Draw BOOM text with animation
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = (currentTime - explosionStartTime) / 1000; // in seconds
    const maxSize = 64;
    const maxSizeTime = 1.0; // reach max size in 1 second
    let size = Math.min(elapsed / maxSizeTime, 1) * maxSize;
    let opacity = 1 - Math.min(elapsed / 2.0, 1); // fade out over 2 seconds

    ctx.font = `${size}px Arial`;
    ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 0, 0, ${opacity})`;
    ctx.fillText('BOOM', explosionCenter.x - size * 0.5, explosionCenter.y + size * 0.4);
}

But this requires that explosionCenter and explosionStartTime are set when the collision occurs.

So in handleCollision:

function handleCollision(v1, v2) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Set explosion center and start time
    explosionCenter = { x: centerX, y: centerY };
    explosionStartTime = performance.now();

    // ... create particles and switch state ...
}

But variables explosionCenter and explosionStartTime need to be declared in the global scope.

So adding:

let explosionCenter = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let explosionStartTime = 0;

Then, in the drawParticles function, during the EXPLODING state, draw the 'BOOM' text as above.

But in the current code, the drawParticles function is called in the EXPLODING state's case. So integrating the 'BOOM' text there.

Alternatively, create a separate function to draw the explosion text.

But this would require modifying the draw logic during EXPLODING state.

So in the animate function's case 'EXPLODING':

case 'EXPLODING':
    updateParticles(dt);
    drawParticles();
    drawExplosionText(); // New function
    checkExplosionEnd();
    break;

Then, the drawExplosionText function:

function drawExplosionText() {
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = (currentTime - explosionStartTime) / 1000;
    const maxSize = 64;
    const maxSizeTime = 1.0;
    let size = Math.min(elapsed / maxSizeTime, 1) * maxSize;
    let opacity = 1 - Math.min(elapsed / 2.0, 1);

    ctx.font = `${size}px Arial`;
    ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 0, 0, ${opacity})`;
    ctx.fillText('BOOM', explosionCenter.x - size * 0.5, explosionCenter.y + size * 0.4);
}

This way, during the EXPLODING state, both particles and the 'BOOM' text are drawn.

Another consideration: the 'BOOM' text should be drawn even if there are no particles left, but the explosion is still in the EXPLODING state. Because the checkExplosionEnd() function switches to RESTARTING only when all particles are gone. So the 'BOOM' text will be drawn until the state changes.

But the explosionStartTime is set when the collision occurs, and the 'BOOM' text is drawn based on elapsed time from that start time. So even after particles are gone, the text will continue to be drawn until the state transitions to RESTARTING.

But according to the requirements, after the explosion animation completes (particles fade), the simulation should wait 3-5 seconds before restarting. However, the current setup switches to RESTARTING as soon as particles are gone, then waits 3 seconds. But the 'BOOM' text may still be visible during that time if the elapsed time hasn't reached the fade-out time.

Hmm. The 'BOOM' text fades out over 2 seconds. So if the explosion happens, the particles may take, say, 1 second to fade, and the 'BOOM' text is visible for 2 seconds. So during the EXPLODING state, both particles and text are drawn. Once particles are gone, checkExplosionEnd() switches to RESTARTING, which waits 3 seconds. But during those 3 seconds, the simulation is in RESTARTING state, and the animate function's case 'RESTARTING' doesn't draw anything. So the 'BOOM' text would stop being drawn once the state is RESTARTING.

But according to the requirements, after the explosion animation completes (particles are gone), the simulation should wait a few seconds before restarting. So the 'BOOM' text should be part of the explosion animation, which is during the EXPLODING state. Once particles are gone, the state transitions to RESTARTING, and the canvas is cleared until the restart.

So the 'BOOM' text is only drawn during the EXPLODING state, which is correct.

Now, testing this: when a collision occurs, the 'BOOM' text appears, grows, and fades over 2 seconds. The particles are created and fade over their lifespan (1 second). So if particles take 1 second to expire, the 'BOOM' text would have been visible for 1 second (since it started at the same time as the particles) and would continue to grow and fade for another second. But since the state transitions to RESTARTING after particles are gone, the 'BOOM' text is no longer drawn. So the total time the 'BOOM' is visible is 1 second (if particles take 1 second) plus whatever time is left in the 2-second fade. But this may not be ideal. To have the 'BOOM' text visible for the entire duration until the state changes, perhaps adjust the lifespan of the particles to be longer, or adjust the 'BOOM' text's fade time to match the maximum possible particle lifespan.

Alternatively, make the 'BOOM' text fade out over 3 seconds, so even after particles are gone, it continues to fade. But since the state is now RESTARTING, the text is no longer drawn. So this approach won't work.

Alternatively, keep the 'BOOM' text visible for the entire explosion duration, which is until the state transitions to RESTARTING. But how to track that.

Alternatively, during the EXPLODING state, the 'BOOM' text is drawn, and when the state transitions to RESTARTING, the text is no longer drawn. So the 'BOOM' text is visible only during the time when particles are present and the state is EXPLODING.

But the requirements say that after the explosion animation completes (particles are gone), the simulation waits 3-5 seconds before restarting. So the 'BOOM' text should be part of the explosion animation, which is during the EXPLODING state. Once the particles are gone, the state transitions to RESTARTING, and the canvas is cleared. The 'BOOM' text is not drawn anymore. The waiting period is in RESTARTING state, where nothing is drawn except perhaps a blank canvas.

So the 'BOOM' text is visible for as long as the EXPLODING state is active, which is until all particles are gone. Once particles are gone, the state switches to RESTARTING, and the canvas is cleared each frame (ctx.clearRect(0,0,...)), so the 'BOOM' text is no longer visible.

But the 'BOOM' text's opacity is based on elapsed time from the explosion start. So even if the particles are gone, the 'BOOM' text would continue to be drawn with increasing size and decreasing opacity until the state changes. But once the state is RESTARTING, the code in the animate function's case 'RESTARTING' does not call drawExplosionText(), so the text is not drawn.

Thus, the 'BOOM' text is only visible during the EXPLODING state, which is correct.

Another thing: in the current code, when a collision is detected, the 'BOOM' text is drawn once in handleCollision, but that's during the RUNNING state. Then, during the EXPLODING state, the drawExplosionText function is called each frame, which draws the animated 'BOOM' text. So the initial draw in handleCollision is redundant and may cause the text to be drawn twice. So better to remove that.

In handleCollision, remove the ctx.fillText('BOOM', ...); line. Instead, rely on the drawExplosionText function during the EXPLODING state.

So the handleCollision function should not draw the 'BOOM' text immediately. Instead, the drawExplosionText function handles it during the EXPLODING state.

So modifying handleCollision:

function handleCollision(v1, v2) {
    // Mark vehicles as inactive
    v1.isActive = false;
    v2.isActive = false;

    // Calculate collision point (average of their positions)
    const centerX = (v1.x + v2.x) / 2;
    const centerY = (v1.y + v2.y) / 2;

    // Set explosion center and start time
    explosionCenter = { x: centerX, y: centerY };
    explosionStartTime = performance.now();

    // Create explosion particles
    for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
        explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(centerX, centerY));
    }

    // Switch to exploding state
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
}

Then, the drawExplosionText function is called during the EXPLODING state.

Now, testing this, the 'BOOM' text should appear at the collision point, expand, and fade over time.

Another consideration: the explosion particles' lifespan is 1 second. So after 1 second, they are all gone, and the state transitions to RESTARTING. The 'BOOM' text, however, is drawn based on elapsed time from explosionStartTime, which could be up to 2 seconds (since opacity is 1 - elapsed/2.0). So if the particles take 1 second to expire, the 'BOOM' text would have been visible for 1 second, and during that time, its size increases to maxSize in 1 second, and opacity decreases from 1 to 0.5. Then, after 1 second, the state transitions to RESTARTING, and the text is no longer drawn. So the 'BOOM' text is visible for 1 second, but the explosionStartTime was set at the collision time, so the elapsed time is from collision to when the particles expire.

But the requirements state that after the explosion animation completes, the simulation waits 3-5 seconds before restarting. However, in the current setup, after the particles are gone (1 second), the state transitions to RESTARTING, which waits 3 seconds (as per the setTimeout). So the total time between collision and restart is 1 + 3 = 4 seconds, which fits the 3-5 seconds requirement.

But the 'BOOM' text is only visible during the 1 second that the particles are active. To make the 'BOOM' text visible for longer, perhaps increase the particle lifespan or adjust the text's animation duration.

Alternatively, the 'BOOM' text should be visible for the entire duration of the explosion state, which is until the particles are gone. But if the particles have a longer lifespan, say 2 seconds, then the 'BOOM' text would be visible for 2 seconds, with size increasing for 1 second and opacity decreasing for 2 seconds.

But this requires adjusting the particle lifespan and the 'BOOM' text's animation times.

In the ExplosionParticle, the lifespan is set to 1 second. So in the ExplosionParticle constructor:

this.lifespan = 1.0; // seconds

To make the particles last longer, increase this value.

For example:

this.lifespan = 2.0; // particles last 2 seconds

Then, the 'BOOM' text's animation times can be adjusted:

In drawExplosionText:

const maxSizeTime = 1.0; // reach max size in 1 second
const fadeTime = 2.0; // fade out over 2 seconds

So the 'BOOM' text grows for 1 second, then stays at max size while fading out over 2 seconds.

But the elapsed time is calculated from explosionStartTime, which is when the collision occurred.

So during the first second, the text grows. During the next second, it stays at max size and fades out. The particles are visible for 2 seconds. So the 'BOOM' text is visible for 2 seconds, then the particles are gone, state transitions to RESTARTING, and after 3 seconds, the simulation restarts.

This would make the 'BOOM' text visible for the entire duration of the explosion particles.

Thus, the explosion animation lasts 2 seconds (particles) + 3 seconds (waiting) = 5 seconds, which fits the requirement.

But the requirements say that after the explosion animation completes (particles are gone), the simulation should wait 3-5 seconds before restarting. So the total time between collision and restart is explosion duration (particles) + waiting time.

In this example, explosion duration is 2 seconds, waiting time is 3 seconds, total 5 seconds.

Alternatively, set the particles' lifespan to 1 second, and the waiting time to 3 seconds, total 4 seconds.

But the requirements allow 3-5 seconds, so either is acceptable.

Now, integrating all these changes into the code.

Another thing: the explosion particles may have different lifespans. For example, some particles could have longer lifespans to create a trailing effect. But in the current code, all particles have the same lifespan (1 second). To make the explosion more dynamic, perhaps vary the lifespan of each particle.

In the ExplosionParticle constructor:

this.lifespan = Math.random() * 1.0 + 0.5; // between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds

Then, the particles will fade out at different times, creating a more natural explosion effect.

But this would mean that the checkExplosionEnd() function, which checks if all particles are gone, may take longer, as some particles could have longer lifespans.

Thus, the explosion duration could be up to 1.5 seconds, and the 'BOOM' text would be visible for up to 1.5 seconds.

But the 'BOOM' text's animation is based on elapsed time from explosionStartTime, which is fixed. So even if particles are visible for 1.5 seconds, the 'BOOM' text would be drawn based on elapsed time, which could be up to 1.5 seconds, but the 'BOOM' text's animation is designed for 2 seconds. So the 'BOOM' text may not reach full size or may fade out too early.

To handle this, perhaps the 'BOOM' text's animation should be based on a fixed duration, not the elapsed time since explosion. For example, the 'BOOM' text grows for 1 second, then stays at max size while fading out over 2 seconds, regardless of when the explosion occurs.

But how to track that. The explosionStartTime is when the collision occurred. The 'BOOM' text's animation is based on that start time.

Alternatively, the 'BOOM' text's animation duration is fixed, say 3 seconds, and it plays once during the explosion.

But this requires tracking the animation state.

Alternatively, since the explosion is a one-time event, the 'BOOM' text's animation can be based on the elapsed time since the explosion started, with fixed durations for growth and fade.

For example:

- Grow to max size over 1 second.
- Stay at max size for 1 second.
- Fade out over 1 second.

Total animation duration: 3 seconds.

But if the particles have a lifespan of 1 second, then the 'BOOM' text would continue to be drawn for 3 seconds, even after the particles are gone and the state has transitioned to RESTARTING. But during RESTARTING state, the 'BOOM' text is not drawn.

Thus, to have the 'BOOM' text animation last 3 seconds, the explosion state must remain EXPLODING for at least 3 seconds, even if the particles are gone.

But according to the current logic, the state transitions to RESTARTING as soon as the particles are gone. So if the particles are gone in 1 second, the state transitions to RESTARTING, and the 'BOOM' text is no longer drawn, even though its animation is supposed to last 3 seconds.

This is a problem.

To resolve this, the state should remain EXPLODING until both the particles are gone and the 'BOOM' text animation is complete.

But how to track that.

Alternatively, the 'BOOM' text animation duration is tied to the particles' lifespan. For example, the 'BOOM' text grows for 1 second, then fades out over the same duration as the particles' lifespan.

But this complicates the code.

Alternatively, the 'BOOM' text animation lasts for a fixed duration, say 3 seconds, and the state remains EXPLODING for that duration, regardless of the particles.

But then, the particles may be gone before the 'BOOM' text animation completes.

But according to the requirements, the explosion animation includes both particles and 'BOOM' text. So the explosion animation is considered complete when both are done.

But tracking that requires checking both the particles and the 'BOOM' text animation.

This can be complex.

Alternatively, define the explosion duration as a fixed time, say 3 seconds. During this time, both particles and 'BOOM' text are animated. After 3 seconds, the state transitions to RESTARTING.

But how to implement this.

In handleCollision:

explosionStartTime = performance.now();
explosionDuration = 3000; // 3 seconds

Then, in checkExplosionEnd():

function checkExplosionEnd() {
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = currentTime - explosionStartTime;
    if (elapsed >= explosionDuration) {
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}

This way, regardless of the particles, the state transitions to RESTARTING after 3 seconds.

But then, the particles may still be visible if their lifespan is longer than 3 seconds, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, set the particles' lifespan to be less than or equal to the explosion duration.

In this case, the explosion duration is 3 seconds. The particles' lifespan is set to, say, 2 seconds. The 'BOOM' text animation is designed to last 3 seconds.

Thus, during the 3 seconds of EXPLODING state, both particles and 'BOOM' text are animated. After 3 seconds, state transitions to RESTARTING, and after 3 seconds of waiting, the simulation restarts.

This fits the requirement of waiting 3-5 seconds after the explosion animation completes.

But the waiting time in RESTARTING is 3 seconds, so total time from collision to restart is 3 (explosion) + 3 (waiting) = 6 seconds, which is longer than the requirement. But the requirement allows 3-5 seconds after the explosion.

Alternatively, set the explosion duration to 2 seconds, and the waiting time to 3 seconds, totaling 5 seconds.

But how to implement this.

Modify the checkExplosionEnd function to check the elapsed time since explosion start:

function checkExplosionEnd() {
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = currentTime - explosionStartTime;
    if (elapsed >= 3000) { // 3 seconds
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}

This way, regardless of the particles, after 3 seconds, the state transitions to RESTARTING.

But then, the particles may still be visible if their lifespan is longer than 3 seconds, but that's unlikely if we set their lifespan to 2 seconds.

Alternatively, set the particles' lifespan to 3 seconds.

In the ExplosionParticle constructor:

this.lifespan = 3.0; // seconds

Then, the particles will be visible for up to 3 seconds, and the checkExplosionEnd function transitions to RESTARTING after 3 seconds.

Thus, the explosion animation lasts 3 seconds, and the simulation waits 3 seconds before restarting, totaling 6 seconds.

But the requirement allows 3-5 seconds after the explosion. So 3 seconds is acceptable.

But the code for checkExplosionEnd is currently:

function checkExplosionEnd() {
    if (explosionParticles.length === 0) {
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}

To change this to check elapsed time instead:

function checkExplosionEnd() {
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = currentTime - explosionStartTime;
    if (elapsed >= 3000) { // 3 seconds
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}

This way, the state transitions to RESTARTING after 3 seconds, regardless of the particles.

But then, the particles may still be visible if their lifespan is longer than 3 seconds. To prevent that, set the particles' lifespan to be less than or equal to 3 seconds.

In the ExplosionParticle constructor:

this.lifespan = Math.random() * 2.0 + 1.0; // between 1 and 3 seconds

This way, particles will have lifespans between 1 and 3 seconds, so they will be gone by the time the state transitions to RESTARTING.

Thus, the explosion animation lasts 3 seconds, during which particles and 'BOOM' text are animated. After 3 seconds, the state transitions to RESTARTING, and after 3 seconds of waiting, the simulation restarts.

This meets the requirement of waiting 3-5 seconds after the explosion animation completes.

Now, integrating all these changes into the code.

Final code outline:

Variables:

let simulationState = 'RUNNING'; // or 'EXPLODING', 'RESTARTING'
let explosionCenter = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let explosionStartTime = 0;
let restartTimer = null;

ExplosionParticle class:

function ExplosionParticle(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.velocityX = Math.random() * 200 - 100; // pixels per second
    this.velocityY = Math.random() * 200 - 100;
    this.lifespan = Math.random() * 2.0 + 1.0; // 1 to 3 seconds
    this.size = Math.random() * 10 + 5;
    this.color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 50%)`;
}

In animate function:

case 'EXPLODING':
    updateParticles(dt);
    drawParticles();
    drawExplosionText();
    checkExplosionEnd();
    break;

case 'RESTARTING':
    if (!restartTimer) {
        restartTimer = setTimeout(() => {
            init();
            simulationState = 'RUNNING';
            restartTimer = null;
        }, 3000);
    }
    break;

Functions:

function checkExplosionEnd() {
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = currentTime - explosionStartTime;
    if (elapsed >= 3000) { // 3 seconds
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}

function drawExplosionText() {
    const currentTime = performance.now();
    const elapsed = (currentTime - explosionStartTime) / 1000; // seconds
    const maxSize = 64;
    const maxSizeTime = 1.0; // reach max size in 1 second
    let sizeScale = Math.min(elapsed / maxSizeTime, 1);
    let size = sizeScale * maxSize;
    let opacity = 1 - Math.min(elapsed / 3.0, 1); // fade out over 3 seconds

    ctx.font = `${size}px Arial`;
    ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 0, 0, ${opacity})`;
    ctx.fillText('BOOM', explosionCenter.x - size * 0.5, explosionCenter.y + size * 0.4);
}

This way, the 'BOOM' text grows for 1 second, then remains at max size while fading out over 3 seconds. However, the state transitions to RESTARTING after 3 seconds, so the 'BOOM' text is visible for the entire 3 seconds of the explosion.

But the explosion duration is 3 seconds, so the 'BOOM' text is visible for the entire duration.

The particles have lifespans between 1 and 3 seconds, so they may still be visible when the state transitions to RESTARTING.

But since the state transitions to RESTARTING after 3 seconds, and the particles' lifespans are up to 3 seconds, some particles may still be visible when the state changes. However, in the next frame, the state is RESTARTING, and the particles are not updated or drawn, so they will disappear.

To ensure that all particles are gone when the state transitions to RESTARTING, the checkExplosionEnd function could check both the elapsed time and whether all particles are gone.

But this complicates the code.

Alternatively, accept that some particles may still be visible for a frame or two after the state transitions, but it's not a big issue.

Thus, the final code should handle the explosion animation as described.

Now, testing this code.

When a collision occurs:

- The two vehicles are marked as inactive.
- The explosion center is set to the collision point.
- explosionStartTime is set to the current time.
- 30 particles are created with lifespans between 1 and 3 seconds.
- simulationState is set to 'EXPLODING'.

In the animate function, during 'EXPLODING' state:

- Particles are updated and drawn.
- 'BOOM' text is drawn with growing size and fading opacity.
- checkExplosionEnd() checks if 3 seconds have elapsed since explosion start. If yes, state transitions to 'RESTARTING'.

In 'RESTARTING' state:

- A timeout is set to restart after 3 seconds.

Once restarted, new vehicles are created, and the process repeats.

This should meet the requirements.

Another thing: when the simulation restarts, the canvas is cleared each frame, so during the 'RESTARTING' state, nothing is drawn except the canvas being cleared. Thus, the canvas is blank during the 3-second waiting period.

This is acceptable.

Thus, the code should work as intended.

Now, writing the full code with all these considerations.

The complete code would include:

- HTML canvas element.
- JavaScript code for the simulation, including vehicle movement, collision detection, explosion handling, etc.

But since the question is about the explosion effect, focusing on that part.

This code creates a simulation where vehicles move around and collide, triggering an explosion effect with particles and a "BOOM" text. The explosion lasts for 3 seconds, after which the simulation restarts after a 3-second waiting period.

The explosion effect includes:

- Particles with random velocities and lifespans.
- A "BOOM" text that grows and fades out over the explosion duration.
- A fixed explosion duration of 3 seconds, after which the simulation restarts.

This should meet the requirements for the explosion effect.
