<think>
We are going to create a simulation with the following structure:

 1. Setup the canvas and context.
 2. Define Vehicle and ExplosionParticle classes.
 3. Manage simulation state (RUNNING, EXPLODING, RESTARTING).
 4. Implement the main animation loop with delta time.
 5. Initialize the simulation with a set number of vehicles.
 6. Handle vehicle movement and wrapping.
 7. Implement collision detection (using axis-aligned bounding boxes for simplicity).
 8. On collision, trigger explosion and switch to EXPLODING state.
 9. Manage explosion particles (create, update, draw, remove when expired).
10. After explosion particles are gone, restart the simulation.

 We'll use:
   - A constant for the number of vehicles (e.g., 5).
   - A constant for the explosion particle count (e.g., 20).
   - A constant for the time to wait after explosion (e.g., 3000 ms).

 Steps in the animation loop:

   if (simulationState === 'RUNNING') {
        updateVehicles();
        checkCollisions();
        if (collisionDetected) {
            triggerExplosion();
            simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
        }
   } else if (simulationState === 'EXPLODING') {
        updateExplosionParticles();
        if (allParticlesExpired) {
            simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
        }
   } else if (simulationState === 'RESTARTING') {
        resetSimulation();
        simulationState = 'RUNNING';
   }

 Note: We'll use a timestamp to calculate delta time.

 Implementation details:

   - Vehicle class:
        * properties: x, y, vx, vy, width, height, color (for visual), isActive
        * draw method: draws a simple car (rectangle for body, two circles for wheels)
        * update: moves the vehicle by (vx * dt, vy * dt) and then wraps.

   - ExplosionParticle class:
        * properties: x, y, vx, vy, size, alpha, lifespan (in milliseconds), color
        * update: moves by (vx * dt, vy * dt), decreases alpha and lifespan.
        * draw: draws a circle with alpha.

   - Collision detection: 
        * We'll check each vehicle against every other vehicle (avoiding self and duplicate pairs).
        * We'll use bounding box collision (rectangles). Since the car is represented by a rectangle, we can check if the rectangles overlap.

   - Wrapping: 
        * If x < 0, set x = canvas.width; if x > canvas.width, set x = 0.
        * Similarly for y.

   - Explosion trigger:
        * When a collision is detected, we get the midpoint of the collision (or the average of the two vehicles' centers?).
        * We create explosion particles at that point with random velocities (outward from the point).

   - State transitions:
        * We'll have a timer for the explosion state (to wait 3 seconds) but note: we are using particle expiration to trigger the restart.
        * However, we are going to wait until all particles have expired (which we can check by having a counter or by checking the last particle's lifespan).

   - We'll manage the explosion particles in an array. When a collision happens, we create the particles and then set the state to EXPLODING.

   - For the explosion, we'll create 20 particles. Each particle gets a random velocity (within a range) and a random color (from a set of explosion colors).

   - We'll use a global variable for the current state and the arrays for vehicles and particles.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Note: We are going to use a fixed canvas size (512x512) as per the HTML.

 Steps:

   1. Set up the canvas and context.
   2. Define constants (number of vehicles, explosion particles, etc.)
   3. Define Vehicle and ExplosionParticle classes.
   4. Initialize the simulation (create vehicles).
   5. Main animation loop.

 We'll structure the code with:

   - A state variable (simulationState) with three states.
   - A variable to track the time when the explosion started (for the waiting period, but note: we are using particle expiration so we don't need a fixed delay? However, we want to wait until the explosion is done. We'll rely on the particles expiring to trigger the restart.)

   However, note: we want to wait for the explosion animation to complete (which is the time it takes for particles to fade). We'll set the lifespan of each particle to about 1000ms, so we can wait for all to expire.

   Implementation:

     In the EXPLODING state, we update the particles and remove expired ones. When the particles array becomes empty, we switch to RESTARTING.

   But note: we might have a very short explosion if particles expire quickly? We'll set the particle lifespan to 1000ms and then we'll wait until the last particle expires. However, we don't know the exact time of the last particle. So we'll just remove particles as they expire and when the array is empty, we restart.

   We'll set the particle lifespan to 1000ms (1 second) and then we'll wait for the particles to expire (which will take about 1 second). Then we restart.

   However, the requirement says "wait for a few (3-5) seconds". So we can set the particle lifespan to 3000ms (3 seconds) and then wait until all particles are gone.

   Let's set particle lifespan to 3000ms.

   Steps for explosion:

     - When collision is detected, we create 20 particles at the collision point (with random velocities and colors).
     - We set simulationState to 'EXPLODING'.
     - Then in the next frames, we update the particles (decrease their alpha and lifespan) and remove them when expired.

   We'll also remove the colliding vehicles (by setting their isActive to false) and then we don't draw them.

   Important: We must not update the vehicles during EXPLODING state.

   Let's code accordingly.

   We'll create:

     const CANVAS_WIDTH = 512;
     const CANVAS_HEIGHT = 512;

     const NUM_VEHICLES = 5;
     const EXPLOSION_PARTICLE_COUNT = 20;
     const EXPLOSION_LIFESPAN = 3000; // milliseconds

   Vehicle class:

     class Vehicle {
        constructor() {
            this.x = Math.random() * CANVAS_WIDTH;
            this.y = Math.random() * CANVAS_HEIGHT;
            this.vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2; // between -1 and 1
            this.vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2;
            this.width = 30;
            this.height = 15;
            this.color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 70%, 50%)`; // random color
            this.isActive = true;
        }

        update(dt) {
            // Update position
            this.x += this.vx * dt;
            this.y += this.vy * dt;

            // Wrap around
            if (this.x < 0) this.x = CANVAS_WIDTH;
            if (this.x > CANVAS_WIDTH) this.x = 0;
            if (this.y < 0) this.y = CANVAS_HEIGHT;
            if (this.y > CANVAS_HEIGHT) this.y = 0;
        }

        draw(ctx) {
            // Draw the car body (rectangle)
            ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
            ctx.fillRect(this.x - this.width/2, this.y - this.height/2, this.width, this.height);

            // Draw wheels (two circles)
            ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
            ctx.beginPath();
            ctx.arc(this.x - this.width/4, this.y + this.height/4, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2);
            ctx.fill();
            ctx.beginPath();
            ctx.arc(this.x + this.width/4, this.y + this.height/4, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2);
            ctx.fill();
        }

        // For collision detection, we return the bounding box
        getBoundingBox() {
            return {
                x: this.x - this.width/2,
                y: this.y - this.height/2,
                width: this.width,
                height: this.height
            };
        }
     }

   ExplosionParticle class:

     class ExplosionParticle {
        constructor(x, y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
            this.vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10; // random velocity in x
            this.vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10; // random velocity in y
            this.size = Math.random() * 5 + 2; // between 2 and 7
            this.alpha = 1.0;
            this.lifespan = EXPLOSION_LIFESPAN; // 3000ms
            this.color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 70%)`; // bright color
        }

        update(dt) {
            this.x += this.vx * dt;
            this.y += this.vy * dt;
            this.lifespan -= dt;
            this.alpha = this.lifespan / EXPLOSION_LIFESPAN;
        }

        draw(ctx) {
            ctx.fillStyle = `rgba(${this.color}, ${this.alpha})`;
            ctx.beginPath();
            ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
            ctx.fill();
        }
     }

   Now, the main simulation:

     let simulationState = 'RUNNING';
     let vehicles = [];
     let explosionParticles = [];
     let lastTime = 0;

     function initSimulation() {
        vehicles = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < NUM_VEHICLES; i++) {
            vehicles.push(new Vehicle());
        }
        explosionParticles = [];
     }

     function checkCollisions() {
        // We'll check every pair of vehicles (without duplicates and without self)
        for (let i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++) {
            if (!vehicles[i].isActive) continue;
            for (let j = i + 1; j < vehicles.length; j++) {
                if (!vehicles[j].isActive) continue;
                if (this.collides(vehicles[i], vehicles[j])) {
                    // Trigger explosion at the midpoint of the two vehicles
                    const midX = (vehicles[i].x + vehicles[j].x) / 2;
                    const midY = (vehicles[i].y + vehicles[j].y) / 2;
                    triggerExplosion(midX, midY);
                    // Mark both as inactive
                    vehicles[i].isActive = false;
                    vehicles[j].isActive = false;
                    // We break after the first collision? Or handle multiple? 
                    // The requirement says "any two", so we'll handle one collision at a time (for simplicity, we break after the first collision).
                    // But note: multiple collisions might happen in one frame? We'll break to avoid multiple explosions in one frame.
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
     }

     function collides(vehicle1, vehicle2) {
        const box1 = vehicle1.getBoundingBox();
        const box2 = vehicle2.getBoundingBox();
        return !(box1.x + box1.width < box2.x || 
                 box2.x + box2.width < box1.x ||
                 box1.y + box1.height < box2.y ||
                 box2.y + box2.height < box1.y);
     }

     function triggerExplosion(x, y) {
        // Create explosion particles
        for (let i = 0; i < EXPLOSION_PARTICLE_COUNT; i++) {
            explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(x, y));
        }
     }

     function updateExplosionParticles() {
        // Update each particle and remove expired ones
        for (let i = explosionParticles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            explosionParticles[i].update(1); // We'll use dt in the main loop, but note: we are using 1 for now? Actually, we'll use dt in the main loop.
            // But note: in the main loop we have dt, so we'll pass dt to update.
            // We'll update in the main loop with dt.
            if (explosionParticles[i].lifespan <= 0) {
                explosionParticles.splice(i, 1);
            }
        }
     }

     function resetSimulation() {
        // Reset the state and reinitialize vehicles
        simulationState = 'RUNNING';
        initSimulation();
        // We don't need to reset explosionParticles because we'll clear it in the next state transition? 
        // But note: when we switch to RESTARTING, we reset the vehicles and then set state to RUNNING. 
        // However, we are going to clear the explosionParticles array in the resetSimulation? 
        // Actually, we are going to set explosionParticles = [] in the resetSimulation? 
        // But note: we are going to set simulationState to RUNNING and then the next frame will draw the new vehicles.
        // We'll clear the explosionParticles array in the resetSimulation.
        explosionParticles = [];
     }

     Now, the main animation loop:

        function animate(timestamp) {
            // Calculate delta time (in seconds)
            const dt = (timestamp - lastTime) / 1000;
            lastTime = timestamp;

            // Clear the canvas
            ctx.clearRect(0, 0, CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT);

            if (simulationState === 'RUNNING') {
                // Update vehicles
                for (let vehicle of vehicles) {
                    if (vehicle.isActive) {
                        vehicle.update(dt);
                    }
                }

                // Check for collisions
                checkCollisions();

                // Draw vehicles
                for (let vehicle of vehicles) {
                    if (vehicle.isActive) {
                        vehicle.draw(ctx);
                    }
                }

            } else if (simulationState === 'EXPLODING') {
                // Update explosion particles
                updateExplosionParticles(); // This function will update each particle with dt

                // Draw explosion particles
                for (let particle of explosionParticles) {
                    particle.draw(ctx);
                }

                // Check if all particles are gone
                if (explosionParticles.length === 0) {
                    simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
                }

            } else if (simulationState === 'RESTARTING') {
                // Reset the simulation
                resetSimulation();
                // We don't draw anything in RESTARTING state? We'll draw the new vehicles in the next frame (RUNNING state)
                simulationState = 'RUNNING'; // We switch to RUNNING immediately, so the next frame will draw the new vehicles.
            }

            requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        }

     However, note: in the RESTARTING state, we reset the simulation and then set the state to RUNNING. But we don't want to draw anything during RESTARTING? 
        We'll set the state to RUNNING and then in the next frame we'll draw the new vehicles.

     But note: the resetSimulation function sets the vehicles and clears explosionParticles, and then we set the state to RUNNING. Then the next frame (which we are about to call) will be in RUNNING state and draw the new vehicles.

     However, we are setting simulationState to 'RUNNING' in the RESTARTING state, and then the next frame will be in RUNNING. So we don't need to do anything else.

     But note: the resetSimulation function is called in the RESTARTING state, and then we set the state to RUNNING. Then the next frame (which we are about to request) will be in RUNNING.

     We'll call requestAnimationFrame(animate) at the end.

     Important: We must initialize the simulation and start the animation.

     Steps at the end:

        initSimulation();
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);

     However, note: the resetSimulation function we defined above does:
        vehicles = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < NUM_VEHICLES; i++) {
            vehicles.push(new Vehicle());
        }
        explosionParticles = [];

     But note: in the RESTARTING state, we call resetSimulation and then set simulationState to 'RUNNING'. Then the next frame will be in RUNNING and draw the new vehicles.

     Let's code accordingly.

     One more note: the checkCollisions function breaks after the first collision. This is acceptable for simplicity.

     We'll also add a "BOOM" text? The requirement says: "Show the 'BOOM' text, maybe expanding at the viewer". We can add a text in the explosion state? But note: the explosion particles are the main effect. We can add a text that appears at the explosion point and fades.

     However, the requirement says "simple visual effects", so we can skip the text to keep it simple? Or we can add a text that is drawn in the explosion state.

     Let's add a simple text: "BOOM" at the explosion point, but only for a short time (like 1 second). We'll create a text object for the explosion? But note: we are already using particles. We can skip the text to avoid complexity? Or we can add it as a particle? 

     Since the requirement says "maybe expanding", we can skip it to keep the code focused on the particles. But let's do a simple text:

        In the EXPLODING state, we can draw "BOOM" at the explosion point (the point where the collision happened) for a few seconds.

     However, note: the explosion point might be multiple points? We are only triggering one explosion per collision. We'll draw the text at the explosion point (midX, midY) for the duration of the explosion.

     But note: we are creating the explosion particles at the same point. We can draw the text at the same point.

     We'll add a variable to store the explosion point for the text? But note: we want the text to be drawn only for the current explosion. We can store the explosion point in a variable when we trigger the explosion.

     However, the requirement says "after the explosion animation completes", so we can just draw the text during the explosion state.

     We'll do:

        In the triggerExplosion function, we set:
            explosionPoint = { x: midX, y: midY };

        Then in the EXPLODING state, we draw the text at explosionPoint.

     But note: we are only having one explosion at a time (because we break after the first collision). So we can store the explosion point.

     Let's add:

        let explosionPoint = null;

        In triggerExplosion(x, y) {
            explosionPoint = { x, y };
            ... create particles ...
        }

        Then in the EXPLODING state, after drawing particles, we draw the text:

            ctx.font = '24px Arial';
            ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
            ctx.textAlign = 'center';
            ctx.fillText('BOOM', explosionPoint.x, explosionPoint.y);

        But note: the text might be too big? And we want it to fade? We can make the text fade with the explosion? We can use the same alpha as the particles? But we don't have an alpha for the text.

        Alternatively, we can draw the text with an alpha that decreases over time? We can store the time when the explosion started and then compute the alpha.

        However, to keep it simple, we'll draw the text without fading for the entire explosion duration.

        But note: the explosion duration is 3 seconds, and the text might be visible for the whole time. That's acceptable.

     We'll add the text drawing in the EXPLODING state.

     However, note: the explosionPoint is set only when we trigger an explosion. So we must reset it when we restart? Actually, when we reset the simulation (in resetSimulation), we set explosionPoint to null.

     We'll initialize explosionPoint = null at the beginning.

     But note: in the RESTARTING state, we reset the simulation and then set the state to RUNNING, so explosionPoint will be set to null in resetSimulation.

     Let's add:

        let explosionPoint = null;

        In resetSimulation:
            explosionPoint = null;

        In triggerExplosion(x, y):
            explosionPoint = { x, y };

        Then in the EXPLODING state:

            if (explosionPoint) {
                ctx.font = '24px Arial';
                ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)'; // 80% opacity
                ctx.textAlign = 'center';
                ctx.fillText('BOOM', explosionPoint.x, explosionPoint.y);
            }

     But note: the text might be drawn on top of the particles? That's acceptable.

     However, the requirement says "expanding at the viewer", so we might want the text to grow? We can do that by scaling the text over time? But that's more complex. We'll leave it as a fixed size for simplicity.

     We'll do the fixed size for now.

     Now, let's code accordingly.

     One more note: the collision detection might be too sensitive? We are using the bounding box of the vehicle (which is a rectangle). The vehicle is drawn as a rectangle with wheels, but the wheels are inside the rectangle. So the bounding box is the entire car. This is acceptable for a simple simulation.

     We'll proceed.

     Let's write the code.

     Note: We are using `dt` in the update for vehicles and particles. But note: the explosion particles update uses `dt` as well.

     We'll adjust the update functions to use `dt`.

     In the Vehicle.update(dt) and ExplosionParticle.update(dt), we use `dt` (which is in seconds).

     However, in the collision check, we don't use dt because we are only checking positions.

     Now, we write the code.

     We'll put everything together.

     Important: We must not forget to set the canvas context.

     Steps:

        const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
        const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

        // Constants
        const CANVAS_WIDTH = canvas.width;
        const CANVAS_HEIGHT = canvas.height;

        // ... rest of the code ...

     We'll define the constants at the top.

     Let's code.
