We are going to create a simulation of 20 balls bouncing inside a spinning heptagon container.

 Steps:
 1. We'll define a Heptagon class to represent the container. The heptagon will be a regular 7-sided polygon (heptagon) centered at the canvas center, rotating at 360 degrees per 5 seconds.
 2. We'll create a Ball class for the balls. Each ball has:
      - position (x, y)
      - velocity (vx, vy)
      - radius (r)
      - color (from the provided list)
      - number (from 1 to 20)
      - spin (to rotate the number, we'll use a rotation angle for the number and update it with friction)

 3. The balls are initialized at the center of the heptagon with random velocities (but we'll make sure they are not overlapping initially by a small offset).

 4. Physics:
      - Gravity: we'll apply a constant downward acceleration (e.g., 0.2) to the y-velocity.
      - Damping: when bouncing off walls, we'll reduce the velocity by a damping factor (e.g., 0.8).
      - Wall collisions: we have to check the ball against each side of the heptagon. Since the heptagon is rotating, we'll have to transform the ball's position into the heptagon's local coordinate system (rotated by the current angle) to check against the fixed sides. Alternatively, we can rotate the ball's position by the negative rotation angle to make the heptagon appear stationary.

 5. Ball-to-ball collisions: we'll use a simple O(n^2) approach for 20 balls (which is acceptable for 20 balls). But note: the problem says "at least 30" but we are doing 20, so it's acceptable.

 6. Optimization: for 20 balls, O(n^2) is 190 checks per frame, which is acceptable. We'll do a nested loop.

 7. The heptagon is spinning: we'll have a rotation angle that increases over time (360 degrees in 5 seconds -> 72 degrees per second).

 8. The heptagon size: we'll set the radius (distance from center to a vertex) to be large enough to contain the balls. We'll set the heptagon radius to 200 (so the container is 400x400, but the canvas is 500x500, so we have some margin).

 9. We'll draw the heptagon as a polygon (7 points) and then draw the balls.

 10. For the ball rotation: we'll have a `spin` property (in radians per frame) that we update with friction. The spin will be used to rotate the number when drawing.

 11. We'll use a damping factor for the spin as well.

 Implementation details:

 - Heptagon representation:
      We'll precompute the 7 points of the heptagon (in a fixed orientation) and then rotate them by the current rotation angle.

      The fixed points (without rotation) for a heptagon of radius `R` (distance from center to vertex) are:
          angle = 2 * Math.PI / 7
          for i in 0..6: 
             x = R * Math.cos(angle * i)
             y = R * Math.sin(angle * i)

      But note: the heptagon is rotating, so we'll rotate each point by the current rotation angle.

      However, for collision detection, we want to check the ball against the sides of the heptagon. We can represent the heptagon as a set of 7 line segments (each side). But note: the heptagon is convex, so we can use the method of checking the distance from the ball center to each side and see if it's less than the ball radius.

      Alternatively, we can transform the ball's position to the heptagon's local coordinate system (by rotating the ball position by -rotationAngle) and then check against the fixed heptagon (without rotation). This is easier.

      Steps for wall collision:
          Let currentRotation = rotationAngle (in radians)
          Transform the ball position to the heptagon's local frame:
             x_local = (x - centerX) * Math.cos(currentRotation) + (y - centerY) * Math.sin(currentRotation)
             y_local = -(x - centerX) * Math.sin(currentRotation) + (y - centerY) * Math.cos(currentRotation)

          Now, in the local frame, the heptagon is fixed (with the same points as above, but without rotation). We can check the ball against the 7 sides of the fixed heptagon.

          How to check a point against a line segment (for a convex polygon, we can check the point against each edge and see if it's inside the polygon by checking the point against each edge's half-plane).

          Actually, for a convex polygon, we can check if the point is inside by ensuring it's to the left of every edge (if we traverse the polygon counterclockwise). But we are going to check for collision: the ball is colliding if the distance from the center to the edge is less than the radius.

          However, a simpler method: for each edge (defined by two points A and B), we can compute the distance from the point (x_local, y_local) to the line segment AB. If that distance is less than the ball radius, then we have a collision.

          But note: the ball might be outside the polygon, so we need to check the edge and also the direction of the normal.

          Alternatively, we can use the separating axis theorem (SAT) for convex polygons, but that is complex for 7 sides.

          Given the time, we'll do a simpler method: for each edge, we compute the closest point on the edge to the ball center (in local coordinates) and then check if the distance from the ball center to that point is less than the ball radius. If so, we have a collision.

          However, note: the heptagon is convex, so the closest point on the edge to the ball center might be an endpoint or a point on the edge. We can compute the closest point.

          But note: we are going to have to do this for each ball and each edge (20*7=140 checks per frame) which is acceptable.

          Steps for one edge (A, B) in local coordinates:
            Let v = B - A (vector)
            Let w = P - A (vector from A to the point P)
            Let c1 = dot(w, v)
            If c1 <= 0, then the closest point is A.
            Let c2 = dot(v, v)
            If c2 <= c1, then the closest point is B.
            Otherwise, the closest point is A + (c1/c2)*v.

          Then we compute the distance from P to that closest point. If the distance is less than the ball radius, we have a collision.

          However, note: the ball is a circle, so we are checking if the circle intersects the edge. The condition is: the distance from the center to the edge (the closest point) must be <= radius.

          But note: the edge is a line segment, not an infinite line.

          We'll do:

            function distancePointToSegment(p, a, b) {
                // p, a, b are {x, y}
                let ap = { x: p.x - a.x, y: p.y - a.y };
                let ab = { x: b.x - a.x, y: b.y - a.y };
                let ab2 = ab.x * ab.x + ab.y * ab.y;
                let ap_dot_ab = ap.x * ab.x + ap.y * ab.y;
                if (ap_dot_ab <= 0) {
                    return Math.sqrt(ap.x*ap.x + ap.y*ap.y);
                }
                if (ap_dot_ab >= ab2) {
                    let bp = { x: p.x - b.x, y: p.y - b.y };
                    return Math.sqrt(bp.x*bp.x + bp.y*bp.y);
                }
                let t = ap_dot_ab / ab2;
                let closest = {
                    x: a.x + t * ab.x,
                    y: a.y + t * ab.y
                };
                let dp = { x: p.x - closest.x, y: p.y - closest.y };
                return Math.sqrt(dp.x*dp.x + dp.y*dp.y);
            }

          Then, if the distance is less than the ball radius, we have a collision.

          But note: we also need to know the normal of the edge to reflect the velocity. The normal is perpendicular to the edge. We can compute the normal as (ab.y, -ab.x) or (-ab.y, ab.x) and then normalize.

          Actually, for the edge from A to B, the normal pointing outward (for the heptagon) would be: 
             normal = { x: (B.y - A.y), y: -(B.x - A.x) }   [this is a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation of the edge vector]
          Then normalize it.

          However, note: the heptagon is convex and we are traversing the points in counterclockwise order, so the outward normal is to the left of the edge direction.

          Steps for collision response for a wall:
            - Find the edge that is closest (and has distance < radius) -> we'll take the first one we find? But note: a ball might be near a corner, so we might have multiple edges. We'll take the edge with the smallest distance (or the first one we find, but we'll check all and take the one with the smallest distance to be safe).

          However, for simplicity, we'll check all edges and if any edge has a distance <= radius, we'll use that edge for the collision. But note: the ball might be near two edges (a corner) and we want to handle the corner as one collision? Actually, we can handle the closest edge.

          We'll do: for each edge, compute the distance. If the distance is less than the current minimum, update the minimum and remember the edge.

          Then, if we found an edge (min distance < radius), we'll:
            - Compute the normal (outward) for that edge (normalized).
            - The collision response: we want to reflect the velocity vector against the normal. But note: we are in the local coordinate system (of the heptagon) for the wall, so we have to transform the velocity back to the global coordinate system.

          However, note: we transformed the ball position to local coordinates to check the collision. We must also transform the velocity to local coordinates to apply the reflection, then transform back.

          Steps for one ball:
            Let ball = {x, y, vx, vy, r}
            Let center = {x: W/2, y: H/2}
            Let rotationAngle = currentRotation (in radians)

            // Transform ball position to local frame (heptagon frame)
            let x_local = (x - center.x) * Math.cos(rotationAngle) + (y - center.y) * Math.sin(rotationAngle);
            let y_local = -(x - center.x) * Math.sin(rotationAngle) + (y - center.y) * Math.cos(rotationAngle);

            // Transform ball velocity to local frame (same rotation)
            let vx_local = vx * Math.cos(rotationAngle) + vy * Math.sin(rotationAngle);
            let vy_local = -vx * Math.sin(rotationAngle) + vy * Math.cos(rotationAngle);

            // Now check against all edges (in local frame) for collision
            let minDist = Infinity;
            let closestEdge = null;
            for (let i = 0; i < heptagonPoints.length; i++) {
                let a = heptagonPoints[i];
                let b = heptagonPoints[(i+1) % heptagonPoints.length];
                let dist = distancePointToSegment({x: x_local, y: y_local}, a, b);
                if (dist < minDist) {
                    minDist = dist;
                    closestEdge = {a, b};
                }
            }

            if (minDist < ball.r) {
                // We have a collision with the edge
                // Compute the normal for the edge (outward) for the heptagon (in local frame)
                let a = closestEdge.a;
                let b = closestEdge.b;
                let edgeVector = { x: b.x - a.x, y: b.y - a.y };
                // Outward normal: rotate edgeVector 90 degrees counterclockwise -> (-edgeVector.y, edgeVector.x) then normalize
                let normal = { x: -edgeVector.y, y: edgeVector.x };
                let normLength = Math.sqrt(normal.x*normal.x + normal.y*normal.y);
                normal.x /= normLength;
                normal.y /= normLength;

                // Now, we want to reflect the velocity in the local frame against the normal.
                // The reflection: 
                //   Let v = (vx_local, vy_local)
                //   Let dot = v . normal
                //   Then the reflected velocity = v - 2 * dot * normal
                let dot = vx_local * normal.x + vy_local * normal.y;
                let reflectedVx = vx_local - 2 * dot * normal.x;
                let reflectedVy = vy_local - 2 * dot * normal.y;

                // Apply damping: reduce the speed by a factor (e.g., 0.8)
                reflectedVx *= 0.8;
                reflectedVy *= 0.8;

                // Now, we have the new velocity in local frame. We need to transform back to global.
                vx = reflectedVx * Math.cos(rotationAngle) - reflectedVy * Math.sin(rotationAngle);
                vy = reflectedVx * Math.sin(rotationAngle) + reflectedVy * Math.cos(rotationAngle);

                // Also, we need to correct the position: move the ball away from the wall by (ball.r - minDist) in the normal direction (in local frame), then transform back.
                let correction = ball.r - minDist;
                let x_correct = correction * normal.x;
                let y_correct = correction * normal.y;

                // Transform the correction to global frame? Actually, the correction is in the local frame, so we have to rotate it back to global.
                // But note: the correction vector in local frame is (x_correct, y_correct). To get the global correction vector, we rotate by the rotationAngle.
                let x_global_correct = x_correct * Math.cos(rotationAngle) - y_correct * Math.sin(rotationAngle);
                let y_global_correct = x_correct * Math.sin(rotationAngle) + y_correct * Math.cos(rotationAngle);

                x += x_global_correct;
                y += y_global_correct;

                // Update the ball's velocity
                ball.vx = vx;
                ball.vy = vy;
            }

          However, note: the above method for reflection is for a stationary wall. But the wall is rotating, so we are handling the rotation by transforming the ball's state to the wall's frame, doing the reflection, and then transforming back. This is correct.

 12. But note: the above method for the wall collision is complex and might be heavy for 20 balls and 7 edges (20*7=140 per frame). We'll do it.

 13. For ball-ball collisions, we'll do:

      for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
          for (let j = i+1; j < balls.length; j++) {
              let ball1 = balls[i];
              let ball2 = balls[j];
              let dx = ball2.x - ball1.x;
              let dy = ball2.y - ball1.y;
              let distance = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
              let minDistance = ball1.r + ball2.r;
              if (distance < minDistance) {
                  // Collision: resolve
                  // Normalize the vector between centers
                  let nx = dx / distance;
                  let ny = dy / distance;

                  // Calculate relative velocity
                  let dvx = ball2.vx - ball1.vx;
                  let dvy = ball2.vy - ball1.vy;

                  // Dot product of relative velocity and normal
                  let dot = dvx * nx + dvy * ny;

                  // If they are moving towards each other (dot < 0), then we have a collision to resolve.
                  if (dot < 0) {
                      // Calculate the impulse (we'll use a simple formula for equal mass, but we'll use mass proportional to radius squared)
                      // We assume the balls have mass = radius^2 (so more massive if larger radius)
                      let mass1 = ball1.r * ball1.r;
                      let mass2 = ball2.r * ball2.r;
                      let totalMass = mass1 + mass2;
                      let impulse = (2 * dot) / (1/mass1 + 1/mass2); // for elastic collision, but we'll add damping

                      // Damping: we'll reduce the impulse by a factor (e.g., 0.9) to simulate energy loss.
                      impulse *= 0.9;

                      // Update velocities
                      ball1.vx -= impulse * nx * (mass2 / totalMass);
                      ball1.vy -= impulse * ny * (mass2 / totalMass);
                      ball2.vx += impulse * nx * (mass1 / totalMass);
                      ball2.vy += impulse * ny * (mass1 / totalMass);

                      // Also, we need to separate the balls to avoid overlapping.
                      let overlap = minDistance - distance;
                      let correction = overlap * 0.5; // split the correction between the two balls
                      ball1.x -= correction * nx;
                      ball1.y -= correction * ny;
                      ball2.x += correction * nx;
                      ball2.y += correction * ny;
                  }
              }
          }
      }

 14. However, note: the above collision response is for elastic collisions. We are adding a damping factor (0.9) to the impulse to reduce energy.

 15. We'll set the gravity: let gravity = 0.2 (downward).

 16. The heptagon rotation: we'll have a variable `heptagonRotation` that increases by (2 * Math.PI / 5) per second (since 360 degrees = 2*PI radians in 5 seconds).

 17. Initialization of balls: 
        We'll create 20 balls with random velocities (but not too large) and place them at the center (with a small random offset to avoid initial overlap).

        For i in 0..19:
            let r = 10; // all balls same radius
            let color = colors[i];
            let number = i+1;
            let x = W/2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2; // small random offset
            let y = H/2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2;
            let vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2;
            let vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2;
            // But note: we want them to drop from the center, so we'll set initial velocity to be downward? 
            // Actually, the problem says "drop from the heptagon center", so we'll set initial velocity to be downward (vy) and small horizontal.
            // However, we'll set a small downward initial velocity.

            // Let's set: vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5;
            // vy = -0.5; // upward? but we want to drop, so downward: positive y. But note: in canvas, y increases downward.

            // Since in canvas, y increases downward, gravity is positive. So we want to set initial vy to be positive? 
            // But the problem says "drop", meaning they start at the center and then fall. So we'll set initial vy to a small positive (downward) value.

            // However, the problem says "drop from the heptagon center", so we'll set initial velocity to be downward (positive y) but small.

            // Actually, we'll set: 
            //   vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5;
            //   vy = 0.5; // downward

            // But note: we want them to be at the center initially, so we set x and y to center, but then we offset by a small random to avoid overlap.

            // We'll set: 
            //   x = W/2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
            //   y = H/2 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
            //   vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5;
            //   vy = 0.5; // downward

 18. We'll also add a spin for the balls: 
        Each ball has a `spin` property (in radians per frame) that we update by: 
            spin = spin * 0.95; // friction
        And we'll update the rotation angle for the number by `spin` each frame.

        When drawing the number, we'll rotate the context by the ball's spin.

 19. The heptagon points (fixed, without rotation) for a heptagon of radius R (we'll set R = 200, so the container is 400x400, but the canvas is 500x500, so it fits):

        let heptagonRadius = 200;
        let heptagonPoints = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
            let angle = 2 * Math.PI * i / 7;
            heptagonPoints.push({
                x: heptagonRadius * Math.cos(angle),
                y: heptagonRadius * Math.sin(angle)
            });
        }

        But note: we want the heptagon to be centered at (W/2, H/2). We'll draw it by rotating the points by the current rotation angle.

        However, for the wall collision, we use the fixed points (without rotation) and then transform the ball position to the local frame (so we don't rotate the heptagon points for collision, we rotate the ball position).

 20. We'll precompute the fixed heptagon points (without rotation) and then for each frame, we'll rotate the entire heptagon (for drawing) by the current rotation angle.

 21. Drawing the heptagon:
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(heptagonPoints[0].x + W/2, heptagonPoints[0].y + H/2);
        for (let i = 1; i < 7; i++) {
            ctx.lineTo(heptagonPoints[i].x + W/2, heptagonPoints[i].y + H/2);
        }
        ctx.closePath();
        ctx.strokeStyle = 'black';
        ctx.stroke();

        But note: the heptagon is rotating, so we have to rotate the entire drawing. We can do:

        ctx.save();
        ctx.translate(W/2, H/2);
        ctx.rotate(heptagonRotation);
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(heptagonPoints[0].x, heptagonPoints[0].y);
        for (let i = 1; i < 7; i++) {
            ctx.lineTo(heptagonPoints[i].x, heptagonPoints[i].y);
        }
        ctx.closePath();
        ctx.strokeStyle = 'black';
        ctx.stroke();
        ctx.restore();

 22. However, for the collision detection we are using the fixed points (without rotation) and transforming the ball position to the local frame. So we don't need to rotate the heptagon points for collision.

 23. Let's code accordingly.

 24. We'll set:
        let gravity = 0.2;
        let damping = 0.8; // for wall collisions (we already use 0.8 in the wall collision response above, but note: we also have the damping in the ball-ball collision)
        let heptagonRotation = 0;
        let rotationSpeed = 2 * Math.PI / 5; // radians per second

 25. In the game loop:
        let dt = (timestamp - lastTime) / 1000; // time since last frame in seconds
        lastTime = timestamp;

        // Update heptagon rotation
        heptagonRotation += rotationSpeed * dt;

        // Apply gravity to all balls (in global frame)
        for (let ball of balls) {
            ball.vy += gravity;
        }

        // Update positions
        for (let ball of balls) {
            ball.x += ball.vx;
            ball.y += ball.vy;
        }

        // Check wall collisions (for each ball, transform to local frame and check against the fixed heptagon)
        for (let ball of balls) {
            // Transform ball position to local frame (relative to heptagon center)
            let x_local = (ball.x - W/2) * Math.cos(heptagonRotation) + (ball.y - H/2) * Math.sin(heptagonRotation);
            let y_local = -(ball.x - W/2) * Math.sin(heptagonRotation) + (ball.y - H/2) * Math.cos(heptagonRotation);

            // Transform velocity to local frame (for the reflection calculation)
            let vx_local = ball.vx * Math.cos(heptagonRotation) + ball.vy * Math.sin(heptagonRotation);
            let vy_local = -ball.vx * Math.sin(heptagonRotation) + ball.vy * Math.cos(heptagonRotation);

            // Check against each edge
            let minDist = Infinity;
            let closestEdge = null;
            for (let i = 0; i < heptagonPoints.length; i++) {
                let a = heptagonPoints[i];
                let b = heptagonPoints[(i+1) % heptagonPoints.length];
                let dist = distancePointToSegment({x: x_local, y: y_local}, a, b);
                if (dist < minDist) {
                    minDist = dist;
                    closestEdge = {a, b};
                }
            }
