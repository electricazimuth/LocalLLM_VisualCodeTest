Okay, I need to create an autonomous aquarium simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The main goal is to have multiple fish swim around in a canvas, moving autonomously with some natural behavior. They should interact with the boundaries and not just bounce off but turn smoothly. Also, the code should follow best practices for object-oriented design, use requestAnimationFrame for the loop, handle delta time, etc.

First, I'll set up the HTML structure. The provided boilerplate has a canvas element. Wait, in the code example, there's a canvas with id 'gameCanvas', but in the second part, the canvas id is 'simulationCanvas'. I need to make sure the JavaScript correctly references the right canvas. Let me check the initial code.

Looking at the initial code:

In the first part:
const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
But the canvas in the HTML has id 'simulationCanvas'. So that's a mistake. I need to correct that. The correct id should be 'simulationCanvas' in the JavaScript.

So first step: Correct the canvas element's id in the JavaScript. Let me note that.

Next, I need to create Fish objects. Each fish has position, velocity, size, color, etc. So I'll create a Fish class or constructor function. Since the user mentioned using object-oriented design, a class is probably better.

The Fish class should have methods to update its position and draw itself. The update method will handle movement, direction changes, and boundary interactions.

For movement, each fish should have a velocity vector. To make movement natural, I can implement a wandering behavior where the direction changes gradually. Maybe using some random variation over time. Also, when approaching the edges, the fish should turn towards the center.

Boundary detection: When a fish is near the edge, it should adjust its direction. For example, if it's near the left edge, it should steer right, and vice versa. Similarly for top and bottom. But to make it smooth, maybe calculate a force that pushes it away from the edge based on proximity.

For the animation loop, using requestAnimationFrame and delta time. The gameLoop function should calculate the time difference between frames and update the fish positions accordingly. This ensures that the movement is frame-rate independent.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Set up the canvas and context correctly.
2. Create a Fish class with properties like x, y, vx, vy, size, color, etc.
3. Generate an array of fish with random initial positions, velocities, colors, sizes.
4. In the gameLoop:
   a. Clear the canvas.
   b. Update each fish's position based on velocity and delta time.
   c. Check for boundary interactions and adjust velocity.
   d. Redraw all fish.
5. Implement the wandering behavior by slightly changing direction over time.
6. Make sure the fish's direction is reflected in their orientation when drawn.

Now, for the Fish class:

Each fish needs to have:

- Position (x, y)
- Velocity (vx, vy)
- Acceleration? Or maybe just adjust velocity based on behaviors.
- Size (width and height, or radius if using circles)
- Color (fill style)
- Maybe a speed factor.

For the visual representation, perhaps draw a simple fish shape. A common approach is to use a triangle for the body and a small line or shape for the tail. Alternatively, an ellipse with a tail. The orientation should face the direction of movement. So, the angle of the fish's body depends on the direction of velocity.

To calculate the direction, we can use Math.atan2(vy, vx) to get the angle in radians.

For the wandering behavior, maybe add a small random angle change each frame. Or have a target direction that changes slowly.

Boundary interaction: When a fish is close to an edge, adjust its direction to steer away. For example, if the fish is near the left edge (x - size/2 < some threshold), then add a force to the right. Similarly for other edges. But how to implement this smoothly.

Alternatively, calculate a steering force based on proximity to edges. For example, the closer the fish is to the edge, the more it should turn away. This can be done by calculating a desired direction away from the edge and adjusting the current velocity towards that direction.

Another approach: When a fish is near an edge, reverse the velocity component that would take it out. But that might be abrupt. Instead, maybe adjust the direction gradually.

Let me think about the update step for each fish:

In each frame:

1. Update the fish's direction with some random variation (wandering).
2. Check proximity to edges and adjust direction to steer away.
3. Update position based on velocity and delta time.
4. Ensure the position stays within the canvas boundaries.

For the wandering, perhaps add a small random angle to the current direction each frame, multiplied by delta time to make it frame-rate independent.

For boundary steering, when the fish is near an edge, calculate a target direction that points away from that edge. Then, adjust the current direction towards that target direction by a certain amount. This way, the turn is smooth.

Now, for the drawing part:

Each fish can be drawn as a combination of shapes. For example, a triangle for the body and a smaller shape for the tail. The entire shape should be rotated based on the direction of movement.

To draw rotated shapes, we can use the canvas context's transform methods. For each fish:

- Save the context state.
- Translate to the fish's position.
- Rotate by the direction angle.
- Draw the fish shape.
- Restore the context state.

But how to calculate the direction angle. The velocity vector's angle can be found with Math.atan2(vy, vx). However, since the canvas rotation is in radians, and the angle needs to be adjusted so that 0 radians points to the right (since atan2 returns 0 for (1,0), which is right). But when drawing, the default rotation is such that 0 radians is to the right. So that should be okay.

But when the fish is moving in a certain direction, we need to rotate the canvas so that the fish's nose points in that direction. So the angle is the direction of the velocity vector.

Now, for the fish shape. Let's say a simple triangle for the body. For example:

- The body is a triangle with the base at the back and the tip at the front. So when the fish is facing right (angle 0), the triangle points to the right.

But when rotated, the entire shape will face the direction of movement.

Alternatively, use an ellipse and a tail. But for simplicity, a triangle might be easier.

Another idea: The fish can be drawn as a polygon with points that form a fish-like shape. For example, using Bezier curves, but that might be more complex. For simplicity, let's go with a triangle and a small tail.

But to make it more fish-like, perhaps a rounded shape. Alternatively, use a single path that forms a fish.

Alternatively, use a simple shape that can be rotated and filled with color.

Let me sketch a simple fish shape:

The body could be an ellipse. The tail could be a small triangle or a line that moves slightly to simulate swimming motion. But for the initial implementation, maybe just a static tail.

But the user mentioned a desirable feature of a tail wiggle. So perhaps add a time-based oscillation to the tail's position or angle.

But that might complicate things. Let's start with a simple shape and then add the tail movement if time permits.

So, for the fish drawing:

The main body is an ellipse. Then, a tail that is a small triangle. The tail's position could be offset based on a sine wave to create a wiggling effect.

Alternatively, the entire fish could be a single path. For example:

- Start at the tail, draw a curve to the body, then to the nose.

But for simplicity, let's start with a triangle for the body and a small rectangle or triangle for the tail.

Let me think of coordinates. Suppose the fish's center is at (x, y). The direction is angle. The body is a triangle that points in the direction of movement. So, when angle is 0 (facing right), the triangle's tip is at (x + length, y). The base is behind.

But how to draw this. Let's define some points relative to the center.

For example, the body could be a triangle with points:

- Tip: (0, 0) relative to center (but when rotated, this will be in the direction of movement)
- Left base: (-width/2, height/2)
- Right base: (width/2, height/2)

Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the fish's body as a triangle where the tip is in the direction of movement. So the three points could be:

- Tip: (0, 0) — but that's the center. Hmm, perhaps the tip is at (length, 0) relative to the center, and the base is at (-length, 0), with some height.

Alternatively, use a polygon with points that form a fish shape. For example:

Let's say the fish has a length and a width. The points could be:

- Nose: (length, 0)
- Left dorsal fin: (length/2, width/2)
- Left tail: (-length/2, width/2)
- Right tail: (-length/2, -width/2)
- Right dorsal fin: (length/2, -width/2)

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is better for now.

Alternatively, use an ellipse for the body and a small triangle for the tail. The tail can be drawn behind the body, and its position can be adjusted based on a sine wave to create a wiggling effect.

But perhaps for the initial implementation, just draw a simple shape that can be rotated. Let's go with a triangle.

Let me outline the steps for drawing a fish:

1. Save the context state.
2. Translate to the fish's position (x, y).
3. Rotate by the direction angle.
4. Draw the fish shape (e.g., a triangle).
5. Restore the context state.

For the triangle, let's define three points relative to the center. For example:

- The tip is at (10, 0) — but scaled by the fish's size.
- The left point is at (-5, 7)
- The right point is at (-5, -7)

But this is arbitrary. The exact coordinates can be adjusted for visual appeal.

Now, the color: each fish can have a random color. Maybe generate a random hue and use HSL for variety.

Now, the Fish class:

The constructor will take x, y, size, color, speed (velocity magnitude), and direction.

But velocity can be represented as a vector (vx, vy), which can be calculated from speed and direction.

Alternatively, store speed and direction, and calculate vx and vy each frame. Or store vx and vy directly. Probably easier to store vx and vy, as they can change over time.

So in the Fish class:

class Fish {
    constructor(x, y, size, color, speed) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.vx = Math.cos(this.direction) * speed;
        this.vy = Math.sin(this.direction) * speed;
        // Or generate random direction initially
        this.direction = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
        this.vx = Math.cos(this.direction) * speed;
        this.vy = Math.sin(this.direction) * speed;
        // Maybe add some randomness to initial velocity
    }

    // Methods to update and draw
}

Wait, perhaps better to have a direction property, and calculate vx and vy from that. Then, when direction changes, vx and vy are updated.

Alternatively, have a velocity vector (vx, vy) and calculate direction from that when needed for drawing.

But for the wandering behavior, it's easier to adjust the direction directly.

So perhaps:

Each fish has a direction (angle in radians), and speed (magnitude of velocity). Then, in each update, adjust the direction based on wandering and boundary interactions, then calculate vx and vy as speed * cos/sin(direction).

But how to handle acceleration or changes in speed? For simplicity, maybe speed remains constant, and direction changes.

So, in the Fish class:

- direction: the current direction of movement (radians)
- speed: scalar value, constant or variable?

The problem says "implement simple autonomous behaviors", so perhaps speed is constant, but direction changes.

So, in the update method:

1. Adjust direction slightly for wandering.
2. Check boundaries and adjust direction to steer away.
3. Update x and y based on direction and speed multiplied by delta time.

But delta time is important here. The gameLoop should pass the delta time to the update methods.

So, in the gameLoop:

let lastTime = 0;

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
    let delta = timestamp - lastTime;
    lastTime = timestamp;
    // convert delta to seconds or keep as milliseconds?
    // For example, if using pixels per second, delta in milliseconds needs to be divided by 1000 to get seconds.
    // So, for each fish:
    // fish.x += fish.vx * delta * 0.001; (if delta is in ms)
    // Or, better to calculate velocity as pixels per millisecond, but that's not standard. Usually, it's per second.

    // So, delta in milliseconds. To get seconds, divide by 1000.
    const deltaTime = delta / 1000;

    // Update each fish with deltaTime
    for (let fish of fishArray) {
        fish.update(deltaTime);
    }

    // Then draw
    drawAll();

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

Then, in the Fish's update method:

update(deltaTime) {
    // Apply wandering: change direction by a small random angle
    const wanderAngle = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1; // +/- 0.05 radians
    this.direction += wanderAngle;

    // Check boundaries and adjust direction
    // For example, if near left edge, steer right
    // Let's say the fish's size is the radius or half the width
    // The fish's bounding box is from x - size to x + size, similarly for y
    // So, if x - size < 0, then we need to steer right
    // Similarly for other edges
    // But how to calculate the steering force?

    // Let's calculate the desired direction based on proximity to edges
    // For each edge, calculate a force that pushes away
    let steerForce = 0;

    // For left edge
    if (this.x - this.size < 0) {
        steerForce += (this.size - (this.x - this.size)) / this.size; // higher value when closer to edge
    }
    // For right edge
    if (this.x + this.size > canvas.width) {
        steerForce -= (this.x + this.size - canvas.width) / this.size;
    }
    // Similarly for top and bottom
    if (this.y - this.size < 0) {
        steerForce += (this.size - (this.y - this.size)) / this.size;
    }
    if (this.y + this.size > canvas.height) {
        steerForce -= (this.y + this.size - canvas.height) / this.size;
    }

    // Apply the steer force to adjust direction
    this.direction += steerForce * deltaTime; // or some factor

    // Update velocity components
    this.vx = Math.cos(this.direction) * this.speed;
    this.vy = Math.sin(this.direction) * this.speed;

    // Update position
    this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
    this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;
}

Wait, but this is a very simplistic approach. The steering force calculation may need more work. Alternatively, calculate a desired direction away from the nearest edge and steer towards that direction.

Another approach inspired by steering behaviors: when a fish is close to an edge, calculate a target direction that points towards the center of the canvas. Then, adjust the fish's direction towards this target direction.

But how to calculate the target direction. For example, if the fish is near the left edge, the target direction could be to the right. Similarly for other edges.

Alternatively, calculate the vector from the fish's position to the center of the canvas. Then, adjust the direction towards that vector.

But that might not be sufficient. Maybe a combination of wandering and edge avoidance.

Another idea: For each edge, compute a repulsion force. The closer the fish is to the edge, the stronger the force pushing away. Then, adjust the direction based on the sum of these forces.

But integrating this into the direction adjustment.

Alternatively, when a fish is within a certain distance from any edge, adjust its direction to point away from that edge. For example:

For each edge, check if the distance is less than a certain threshold (like 50 pixels). If so, calculate the desired direction as away from that edge.

But how to handle multiple edges. For example, if the fish is in a corner, it needs to steer away from both edges.

But perhaps for simplicity, handle each edge separately and adjust the direction accordingly.

Let me think of code for boundary interaction:

In the update method:

// Check proximity to edges
const padding = 50; // distance from edge to start steering
const steerMagnitude = 0.1; // how much to adjust direction

let desiredDirection = 0;

if (this.x - this.size < padding) {
    // Too close to left edge, steer right
    desiredDirection = 0; // right direction is 0 radians
} else if (this.x + this.size > canvas.width - padding) {
    // Too close to right edge, steer left (PI radians)
    desiredDirection = Math.PI;
} else if (this.y - this.size < padding) {
    // Too close to top, steer down (PI/2 radians)
    desiredDirection = Math.PI / 2;
} else if (this.y + this.size > canvas.height - padding) {
    // Too close to bottom, steer up (3PI/2 or -PI/2)
    desiredDirection = -Math.PI / 2;
} else {
    // No steering needed
    desiredDirection = this.direction;
}

// Now, adjust current direction towards desiredDirection
const angleDiff = desiredDirection - this.direction;
const deltaAngle = Math.abs(angleDiff);
if (deltaAngle > Math.PI) {
    // Take the shorter path
    this.direction += (angleDiff > 0 ? -Math.PI : Math.PI);
} else {
    this.direction += (angleDiff > 0 ? 1 : -1) * Math.min(deltaAngle, 0.1); // adjust by up to 0.1 radians per frame
}

But this is a bit simplistic. Alternatively, use a smooth turn towards the desired direction. For example, the fish can only turn by a certain amount per second.

So, the maximum turn rate could be a property. For example, turnRate = 2 radians per second. Then, the direction change is turnRate * deltaTime.

But how to calculate the shortest angle between current and desired direction.

This is a common problem in game development. The formula to find the shortest angle difference:

function shortestAngle(a, b) {
    const diff = a - b;
    return (diff + Math.PI) % (2 * Math.PI) - Math.PI;
}

Then, adjust the direction by the minimum of turnRate * deltaTime and the angle difference.

So, in code:

const turnRate = 2; // radians per second
const angleToTarget = shortestAngle(desiredDirection, this.direction);
const turnAmount = Math.min(turnRate * deltaTime, Math.abs(angleToTarget));
this.direction += angleToTarget > 0 ? turnAmount : -turnAmount;

But integrating this into the Fish's update method.

This would allow the fish to smoothly turn towards the desired direction.

But how to compute desiredDirection based on the edges.

Alternatively, when near any edge, compute a direction that points away from that edge. For example, if the fish is near the left edge, the desired direction is to the right (0 radians). If near the right edge, desired direction is to the left (PI radians). Similarly for top and bottom.

But if the fish is near a corner, it might need to combine directions. However, this approach may not handle that well. But for simplicity, perhaps just check which edge is closest and steer away from that.

Alternatively, calculate the distance to each edge and apply a steering force in the opposite direction.

But perhaps for the initial implementation, a simpler approach would be better. Let's proceed with checking each edge and adjusting the direction accordingly.

Now, putting this all together.

Let me outline the Fish class:

class Fish {
    constructor(x, y, size, color, speed) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.direction = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
        this.vx = Math.cos(this.direction) * speed;
        this.vy = Math.sin(this.direction) * speed;
        // Maybe add some variation to initial speed or direction
    }

    update(deltaTime) {
        // Wandering: add small random angle change
        const wanderAngle = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1; // +/- 0.05 radians
        this.direction += wanderAngle;

        // Boundary interaction
        // Check each edge and adjust direction if needed
        const steerForce = 0.1; // how much to adjust per frame (radians)
        const padding = 50; // distance from edge to start steering

        let desiredDirection = this.direction;

        if (this.x - this.size < padding) {
            // Close to left edge, steer right (0 radians)
            desiredDirection = 0;
        } else if (this.x + this.size > canvas.width - padding) {
            // Close to right edge, steer left (PI radians)
            desiredDirection = Math.PI;
        } else if (this.y - this.size < padding) {
            // Close to top, steer down (PI/2)
            desiredDirection = Math.PI / 2;
        } else if (this.y + this.size > canvas.height - padding) {
            // Close to bottom, steer up (3PI/2 or -PI/2)
            desiredDirection = -Math.PI / 2;
        }

        // Calculate the angle difference between current and desired direction
        const angleDiff = desiredDirection - this.direction;
        const adjustedAngle = this.direction + (angleDiff > 0 ? 1 : -1) * Math.min(Math.abs(angleDiff), steerForce * deltaTime);

        // Apply the adjustment
        this.direction = adjustedAngle;

        // Update velocity components
        this.vx = Math.cos(this.direction) * this.speed;
        this.vy = Math.sin(this.direction) * this.speed;

        // Update position
        this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
        this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;

        // Ensure the fish stays within the canvas
        // Clamp position to be within [size, canvas.width - size] for x and y
        this.x = Math.max(this.size, Math.min(this.x, canvas.width - this.size));
        this.y = Math.max(this.size, Math.min(this.y, canvas.height - this.size));
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        // Save context state
        ctx.save();
        // Translate to position
        ctx.translate(this.x, this.y);
        // Rotate by direction
        ctx.rotate(this.direction);
        // Draw the fish shape
        ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
        // Example: draw a triangle
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(10, 0); // tip
        ctx.lineTo(-10, 7); // left base
        ctx.lineTo(-10, -7); // right base
        ctx.closePath();
        ctx.fill();
        // Restore context
        ctx.restore();
    }
}

Wait, but this code may have some issues. For example, the rotation direction. The canvas rotation is such that positive angles rotate clockwise. But the standard mathematical direction is counter-clockwise. So, when using Math.atan2(vy, vx), which returns the angle from the positive x-axis, rotating the canvas by that angle would point the fish in the correct direction.

But when we rotate the context by this.direction, the fish's tip (which is at (10, 0) in local coordinates) would point in the direction of movement. So that should be correct.

But let me test this. Suppose the direction is 0 radians (facing right). The triangle's tip is at (10, 0), so after rotation (which is 0), the tip is pointing to the right. Correct.

If direction is Math.PI/2 (90 degrees, facing down), then the rotation would be 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which points down. Wait, but Math.PI/2 is 90 degrees, which would rotate the context so that the positive y-axis points down. So the tip would point down. Correct.

So the rotation seems correct.

Now, for the wandering behavior. Adding a small random angle each frame. The code adds (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1, which gives a value between -0.05 and +0.05. This should create a gradual change in direction.

For boundary interaction, the code checks if the fish is within padding of any edge. If so, it sets desiredDirection to a specific value (like 0 for right, PI for left, etc.), then adjusts the current direction towards that desired direction by a small amount (steerForce * deltaTime). However, the current code uses a fixed steerForce of 0.1 and multiplies by deltaTime. But deltaTime is already in seconds, so steerForce would be in radians per second. For example, 0.1 radians per second. So multiplying by deltaTime (seconds) gives the angle to adjust.

But in the code above, the line:

const adjustedAngle = this.direction + (angleDiff > 0 ? 1 : -1) * Math.min(Math.abs(angleDiff), steerForce * deltaTime);

This seems to be trying to adjust the direction by the minimum of the angle difference and the maximum possible turn (steerForce * deltaTime). But this approach might not be the best. A better way would be to calculate the shortest angle between current and desired direction, then turn towards it by up to the maximum turn rate.

Alternatively, use the shortest angle difference and adjust by the turn rate * deltaTime.

Let me adjust the code:

In the update method:

// After calculating desiredDirection:

// Calculate the shortest angle between current and desired direction
let angleDiff = desiredDirection - this.direction;
// Normalize the angle difference to be between -PI and PI
angleDiff = (angleDiff + Math.PI) % (2 * Math.PI) - Math.PI;

// Determine the maximum turn angle based on turn rate and delta time
const turnRate = 2; // radians per second
const maxTurn = turnRate * deltaTime;

// Turn towards the desired direction by up to maxTurn
if (Math.abs(angleDiff) > maxTurn) {
    this.direction += angleDiff > 0 ? maxTurn : -maxTurn;
} else {
    this.direction += angleDiff;
}

This way, the fish turns smoothly towards the desired direction at a maximum rate of turnRate radians per second.

This would handle the shortest path and ensure smooth turns.

So integrating this into the Fish's update method.

Now, for the initial setup:

Create an array of fish. Each fish has random x, y, size, color, speed.

For colors, perhaps generate a random HSL value. For example:

const color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 70%, 50%)`;

Sizes can vary between, say, 10 and 30.

Speeds can vary between 50 and 150 pixels per second.

But need to make sure that the fish don't move too fast or too slow. The speed should be multiplied by deltaTime in the update, so the speed is in pixels per second.

So, in the Fish constructor:

this.speed = Math.random() * 100 + 50; // between 50 and 150 px/s

Now, the main setup:

In the JavaScript code:

const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const W = canvas.width;
const H = canvas.height;

const fishCount = 15;
const fishArray = [];

function createFish() {
    const size = Math.random() * 20 + 10; // 10-30
    const speed = Math.random() * 100 + 50;
    const color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 70%, 50%)`;
    const x = Math.random() * W;
    const y = Math.random() * H;
    return new Fish(x, y, size, color, speed);
}

for (let i = 0; i < fishCount; i++) {
    fishArray.push(createFish());
}

Then, in the gameLoop:

let lastTime = 0;

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
    const delta = timestamp - lastTime;
    lastTime = timestamp;
    const deltaTime = delta / 1000; // convert to seconds

    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);
    ctx.fillStyle = '#e0f7fa'; // light blue background
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, W, H);

    // Update and draw all fish
    for (const fish of fishArray) {
        fish.update(deltaTime);
        fish.draw(ctx);
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

Wait, but the initial code in the boilerplate has a canvas with id 'simulationCanvas' and the JavaScript code in the second part. So the code should correctly reference that.

Now, the Fish class's draw method. The current example draws a triangle with points at (10,0), (-10,7), (-10,-7). But when rotated, this would look like a fish pointing in the direction of movement. However, the size of the fish is determined by the 'size' property. Wait, in the current code, the 'size' is stored, but in the draw method, the coordinates are fixed. So the size isn't used. That's a problem.

We need to scale the fish based on its size. So, in the draw method, after translating and rotating, we can scale the context by the size.

But how to represent the size. Let's say the 'size' property is a scaling factor. For example, the base size of the fish is 10 units, and the actual size is multiplied by this.size.

Alternatively, the 'size' can represent the width or height of the fish, and the drawing commands use that.

Let me adjust the draw method:

In the Fish class's draw method:

draw(ctx) {
    ctx.save();
    ctx.translate(this.x, this.y);
    ctx.rotate(this.direction);
    // Scale by size
    ctx.scale(this.size / 10, this.size / 10); // assuming base size is 10
    ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(10, 0);
    ctx.lineTo(-10, 7);
    ctx.lineTo(-10, -7);
    ctx.closePath();
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.restore();
}

This way, the fish's size is scaled by the 'size' property. For example, if size is 20, then it's scaled by 2, making it twice as big.

But the 'size' property in the Fish constructor is used for collision detection (boundary checks). So when checking boundaries, the 'size' should represent the radius or half the width. For example, if the fish's drawn size is scaled, then the actual size in pixels is (size / 10) * 10 = size. Because the base drawing is 10 units, scaled by size/10. So the total size would be size pixels.

Wait, let's think:

The base drawing (without scaling) is 10 units wide (from x=-10 to x=10). When scaled by size/10, the width becomes (10 * 2) * (size/10) = 2 * size. Wait, no:

The base width is from -10 to +10 in x, so 20 units. Scaling by size/10 would make the width 20 * (size/10) = 2 * size. But this may complicate the boundary checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'size' property represents the radius of the fish. For example, the fish's bounding circle has radius 'size'. Then, in the drawing, the fish is scaled so that its bounding box fits within that radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'size' is the maximum extent from the center. For example, the fish's drawn size is such that it fits within a circle of radius 'size'.

But this might complicate things. For simplicity, let's assume that the 'size' is the radius of a circle that encloses the fish. Then, when checking boundaries, the fish is within the canvas if its center is at least 'size' pixels away from the edges.

In the Fish constructor, the initial x and y should be within [size, canvas.width - size] and same for y.

So in the createFish function:

const x = Math.random() * (W - 2 * size) + size;
const y = Math.random() * (H - 2 * size) + size;

But since 'size' is determined before creating the fish, this may not be possible. Alternatively, generate x and y within the valid range, but considering that the fish's size may vary.

Alternatively, after creating the fish, clamp its x and y to be within the valid range.

In the Fish's update method, after updating x and y, clamp them:

this.x = Math.max(this.size, Math.min(this.x, W - this.size));
this.y = Math.max(this.size, Math.min(this.y, H - this.size));

This ensures that the fish's center is at least 'size' pixels away from the edges.

Now, the draw method scales the fish so that its base size (10 units) is scaled to 'size' pixels. For example:

ctx.scale(this.size / 10, this.size / 10);

So the base width of 20 units (from -10 to +10) becomes 20 * (size/10) = 2 * size pixels. But this would make the fish's actual width 2 * size pixels, which may not be desired.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'size' represents the width of the fish. For example, the fish is drawn with a width of 'size' pixels. Then, in the draw method, the base width is 10 units, scaled by size/10.

But this requires careful calculation.

Alternatively, let's define the fish's size as the distance from the center to the tip. For example, the tip is at (10, 0) in base units, so the length from center to tip is 10 units. Then, scaling by size/10 would make the actual length 'size' pixels. The width would be 14 units (from -10 to -10 in x, and y from -7 to 7), scaled by size/10, making the actual width 14 * (size/10) = 1.4 * size pixels.

But for boundary checks, we need to consider the maximum extent of the fish in any direction. The maximum distance from the center to any point on the fish is the length of the tip (10 units) plus the width (but in this case, the tip is the farthest point). So the 'size' should be at least 10 units * scale. Since scale is size/10, the actual size in pixels is size.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's easier to define the 'size' as the radius of a circle that encloses the fish. Then, the fish's drawn size is scaled such that it fits within a circle of radius 'size' pixels.

For example, the farthest point of the fish in base units is the tip at (10, 0), which is 10 units away. To make this distance equal to 'size' pixels, we scale by size / 10.

So in the draw method:

ctx.scale(this.size / 10, this.size / 10);

This way, the tip is at (10 * (size/10), 0) = (size, 0), which is 'size' pixels away from the center. Therefore, the 'size' property represents the distance from the center to the tip, which is the maximum extent of the fish.

Therefore, in boundary checks, the fish is within the canvas if its center is at least 'size' pixels away from the edges.

This makes sense.

Now, in the createFish function:

const size = Math.random() * 20 + 10; // 10 to 30 pixels

const x = Math.random() * (W - 2 * size) + size;
const y = Math.random() * (H - 2 * size) + size;

But this requires knowing 'size' before generating x and y. However, in the current setup, 'size' is generated first, so this is possible.

But in the current code, the createFish function is:

function createFish() {
    const size = Math.random() * 20 + 10; // 10-30
    const speed = Math.random() * 100 + 50;
    const color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 70%, 50%)`;
    const x = Math.random() * W;
    const y = Math.random() * H;
    return new Fish(x, y, size, color, speed);
}

This may result in fish being placed outside the valid area. To fix this:

function createFish() {
    const size = Math.random() * 20 + 10;
    const speed = Math.random() * 100 + 50;
    const color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 70%, 50%)`;
    const x = Math.random() * (W - 2 * size) + size;
    const y = Math.random() * (H - 2 * size) + size;
    return new Fish(x, y, size, color, speed);
}

This ensures that the fish is placed within the canvas, considering its size.

Now, putting all this together.

Another thing to consider is the initial direction. The fish could be facing in any direction, which is fine.

Now, testing the code.

Potential issues:

- The rotation may be clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. To check, when direction is 0, the fish should face right. When direction is Math.PI/2, it should face down.

- The scaling in the draw method.

- The boundary checks and steering.

Another thing to add is the tail or some animation to make the fish look more realistic. For example, oscillating the tail.

But for simplicity, let's proceed with the current code.

Now, the complete JavaScript code:

// Get canvas context
const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const W = canvas.width;
const H = canvas.height;

// Fish class
class Fish {
    constructor(x, y, size, color, speed) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.size = size;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.direction = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
    }

    update(deltaTime) {
        // Wandering: add small random angle change
        const wanderAngle = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1; // +/- 0.05 radians
        this.direction += wanderAngle;

        // Boundary interaction
        const padding = 50; // distance from edge to start steering
        let desiredDirection = this.direction;

        if (this.x - this.size < padding) {
            // Close to left edge, steer right (0 radians)
            desiredDirection = 0;
        } else if (this.x + this.size > W - padding) {
            // Close to right edge, steer left (PI radians)
            desiredDirection = Math.PI;
        } else if (this.y - this.size < padding) {
            // Close to top, steer down (PI/2)
            desiredDirection = Math.PI / 2;
        } else if (this.y + this.size > H - padding) {
            // Close to bottom, steer up (3PI/2 or -PI/2)
            desiredDirection = -Math.PI / 2;
        }

        // Calculate the shortest angle between current and desired direction
        let angleDiff = desiredDirection - this.direction;
        // Normalize the angle difference to be between -PI and PI
        angleDiff = (angleDiff + Math.PI) % (2 * Math.PI) - Math.PI;

        // Determine the maximum turn angle based on turn rate and delta time
        const turnRate = 2; // radians per second
        const maxTurn = turnRate * deltaTime;

        // Turn towards the desired direction by up to maxTurn
        if (Math.abs(angleDiff) > maxTurn) {
            this.direction += angleDiff > 0 ? maxTurn : -maxTurn;
        } else {
            this.direction += angleDiff;
        }

        // Update velocity components
        this.vx = Math.cos(this.direction) * this.speed;
        this.vy = Math.sin(this.direction) * this.speed;

        // Update position
        this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
        this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;

        // Clamp position to stay within canvas bounds
        this.x = Math.max(this.size, Math.min(this.x, W - this.size));
        this.y = Math.max(this.size, Math.min(this.y, H - this.size));
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.save();
        ctx.translate(this.x, this.y);
        ctx.rotate(this.direction);
        // Scale by size (base size is 10 units, scaled to 'size' pixels)
        ctx.scale(this.size / 10, this.size / 10);
        ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
        // Draw the fish shape (triangle)
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(10, 0); // tip
        ctx.lineTo(-10, 7); // left base
        ctx.lineTo(-10, -7); // right base
        ctx.closePath();
        ctx.fill();
        ctx.restore();
    }
}

// Create fish array
const fishCount = 15;
const fishArray = [];

function createFish() {
    const size = Math.random() * 20 + 10; // 10 to 30 pixels
    const speed = Math.random() * 100 + 50; // 50 to 150 px/s
    const color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 70%, 50%)`;
    const x = Math.random() * (W - 2 * size) + size;
    const y = Math.random() * (H - 2 * size) + size;
    return new Fish(x, y, size, color, speed);
}

for (let i = 0; i < fishCount; i++) {
    fishArray.push(createFish());
}

// Animation loop
let lastTime = 0;

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
    const delta = timestamp - lastTime;
    lastTime = timestamp;
    const deltaTime = delta / 1000; // in seconds

    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);

    // Update and draw all fish
    for (const fish of fishArray) {
        fish.update(deltaTime);
        fish.draw(ctx);
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

This should create a school of fish that wander around and steer away from the edges of the canvas.

Potential improvements:

- Add more complex fish shapes.
- Implement flocking behavior (alignment, cohesion).
- Add animation to the fish (e.g., oscillating tail).
- Improve the steering behavior for more natural movement.

But for the purpose of this question, the code should demonstrate the basic functionality. </think>
To create a realistic simulation of fish swimming in a tank, we need to implement the following components:

1. **Fish Class**: Represents each fish with properties like position, size, color, speed, and direction.
2. **Movement and Steering**: Fish should wander randomly but steer away from the edges of the tank.
3. **Rendering**: Draw each fish on the canvas, scaling and rotating based on their direction.
4. **Animation Loop**: Continuously update and render the fish to create a smooth animation.

### Explanation:

1. **Fish Class**:
   - Each fish has a position (`x`, `y`), size, color, speed, and direction.
   - The `update` method handles movement, including wandering and steering away from tank edges.
   - The `draw` method renders the fish as a triangle, scaled and rotated based on its direction.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - **Wandering**: Fish randomly change direction slightly each frame.
   - **Steering**: When near the tank edges, fish steer away by adjusting their direction towards the center.

3. **Rendering**:
   - Fish are drawn as triangles, with their size and color randomized during creation.
   - The canvas is cleared and redrawn in each frame to create the animation effect.

4. **Animation Loop**:
   - The `gameLoop` function continuously updates and redraws the fish using `requestAnimationFrame`, ensuring smooth animation.

This code creates a realistic simulation of fish swimming in a tank, with natural movement and steering behavior.
