<think>
Okay, I need to create a simulation of Happy Mrs. Chicken using HTML, JS, and Canvas. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the requirements. The main parts are the Chicken object and Egg objects. The Chicken moves around, sometimes lays eggs, which stay on screen. The movement should be AI-driven with wandering behavior, changing direction randomly, and staying within the canvas boundaries. Eggs are static once laid.

So, the first thing I need to do is set up the HTML and Canvas. The provided boilerplate has a canvas with 512x512 pixels. The background is a light green, which is good for a grassy area.

Next, the JavaScript code. I need to create a Chicken class. The Chicken should have properties like position (x, y), velocity (direction and speed), and a state (like wandering or laying). Also, a timer to check when to lay an egg.

For the egg-laying mechanism, maybe a timer that counts down and when it hits zero, the chicken lays an egg. Then, after laying, it resets the timer. The timer should use delta time to ensure it's frame-rate independent.

Egg objects need to be stored in an array. Each egg has a position where it was laid. They don't move, so their position is fixed once created.

The movement logic for the chicken: when wandering, it moves in a direction. When it hits the canvas edge, it should turn. So, for boundary handling, I need to check if the chicken's next position would be outside the canvas. If so, reverse the direction or change it. Maybe randomize the direction when hitting a boundary.

The wandering behavior can be implemented by randomly changing direction every so often. Maybe after a certain number of frames or using a probability check (like once every few seconds of game time). The velocity can have a magnitude (speed) and direction angle.

Drawing the chicken: need to draw a shape that looks like a chicken. The basic shape could be a circle with a triangle beak. Maybe a polygon for the body and a triangle for the beak. The direction of the beak should point in the direction the chicken is moving. So the rotation of the chicken's body should align with its velocity direction.

When laying an egg, the chicken pauses. So during the laying state, the chicken's velocity is zero, and after a short delay (maybe 1 second), it resumes moving. The egg is created at the chicken's current position, but maybe slightly offset. For example, the egg is placed a bit behind the chicken's center, like at the position (x - 10, y) if the chicken is facing right. Or maybe based on the direction the chicken is moving.

The egg should be drawn as an oval. Using the Canvas arc function, maybe with a slightly different radius in x and y to make it oval.

For the simulation loop, using requestAnimationFrame. In each frame, I need to update the chicken's state (check if it's time to lay an egg), update its position (if not laying), and draw everything.

Eggs need to be stored in an array. Each frame, check if eggs should disappear after a certain time. Maybe eggs have a lifespan (like 10 seconds) and are removed from the array when their timer expires.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Set up the canvas and get the context.

2. Create Chicken class with properties: x, y, vx, vy (velocity components), state (wandering or laying), eggLayTimer, layDuration, etc.

3. Create Egg class with properties: x, y, spawnTime, lifespan (maybe 10 seconds).

4. Array to hold all active eggs.

5. Animation loop using requestAnimationFrame.

6. In each frame:
   a. Update chicken's state: check if eggLayTimer is active. If laying, decrement the layDuration. If timer reaches zero, create an egg, reset timer, and resume movement.
   b. Update chicken's position: if not laying, move based on velocity. Check boundaries and adjust direction if needed.
   c. Check for boundary collisions: if chicken's new position would be outside canvas, reverse direction or change to a new random direction.
   d. If the chicken is wandering, check if it's time to change direction (random chance).
   e. If the chicken is laying, do not move, and after layDuration, switch back to wandering.
   f. Create an egg when laying finishes: store in the eggs array.

7. Drawing:
   a. Clear canvas with green background.
   b. Draw chicken: based on current position and direction. Use canvas transformations (translate and rotate) to draw the beak facing the direction.
   c. Draw all eggs from the array.

Now, implementing the Chicken class. The chicken's movement can be based on velocity components (vx, vy) which represent the direction and speed. For example, moving at a certain speed in the current direction. When changing direction, the velocity vectors need to be updated.

Alternatively, the chicken can have a direction angle and a speed. The velocity components would be speed * cos(angle) and speed * sin(angle). This way, changing direction is just changing the angle.

But for simplicity, maybe using velocity components (vx, vy) which can be updated when changing direction. For example, when the chicken needs to turn, set new vx and vy to random values that are normalized to unit vector multiplied by speed.

Boundary handling: when the chicken's x or y would go outside the canvas, reverse the corresponding velocity component. For example, if the chicken is moving right (vx positive) and is approaching the right edge, then when x + vx > canvas.width, set vx to -vx (reverse direction). Or, maybe when approaching the edge, change direction to a random angle.

Alternatively, when the chicken is near the edge, pick a new random direction that points away from the edge. For example, if the chicken is near the right edge, the new direction should have a negative x component.

For the egg-laying trigger, perhaps a timer that counts down. When the timer reaches zero, the chicken enters the 'laying' state. In this state, the chicken stops moving (velocity zero), and after a short duration (like 1 second), it creates an egg, resets the timer, and resumes movement.

The egg's position is the chicken's current position. But to make it look like the egg is laid behind the chicken, we might need to adjust the position based on the chicken's direction. For example, if the chicken is moving right, the egg is placed 10 pixels to the left of the chicken's center. So the egg's x is chicken.x - 10, y is chicken.y.

For the egg's lifespan, when an egg is created, we store its spawnTime. In each frame, check if the current time (game time) minus spawnTime exceeds the lifespan. If so, remove the egg from the array.

Now, about the game loop and delta time. Delta time is the time elapsed since the last frame. We need to use this to update the chicken's position correctly, regardless of frame rate. For example, if the chicken's speed is 50 pixels per second, then in each frame, it moves speed * deltaTime (in seconds) pixels.

Similarly, the egg-lay timer should count down based on delta time. If the lay interval is 5 seconds, then in each frame, subtract deltaTime from the timer. When it reaches zero, trigger the laying.

Implementing the chicken's wandering behavior: perhaps every few seconds (like 2-3 seconds), randomly change direction. So, in the update loop, check if a random chance (e.g., 5% per frame) triggers a direction change. When triggered, set a new direction (angle) and speed.

Now, coding steps:

1. HTML: The canvas is already set up in the boilerplate.

2. JS:

   a. Get the canvas and context.

   b. Create Chicken and Egg classes.

   Chicken class:
   - constructor: initial position (center of canvas?), velocity (random direction), state (wandering), eggLayTimer (set to layInterval), layDuration (e.g., 1 second), speed.

   Egg class:
   - constructor: x, y, spawnTime (current game time).

   c. Setup variables: eggs array, game time, last frame time.

   d. Animation loop function using requestAnimationFrame.

   In the loop:

   - Calculate delta time (current time - last frame time).

   - Update game time (add delta time).

   - Update chicken's state:

      - If in 'laying' state, decrement layDuration. When it's done, create an egg, reset timer, switch back to wandering.

      - If in 'wandering' state, check if it's time to lay an egg (eggLayTimer reaches zero). If yes, switch to 'laying' state, reset timer.

   - Update chicken's position based on velocity (if not laying).

   - Check boundaries and adjust velocity if needed.

   - Check if the chicken should change direction (random chance).

   - For each egg, check if its lifespan has expired.

   - Draw the chicken and eggs.

3. Drawing the chicken:

   - Use canvas transformations (save, translate to chicken's position, rotate to direction, draw body and beak, restore).

   Body could be a circle. Beak is a triangle pointing in the direction.

   For example:

   context.save();
   context.translate(chicken.x, chicken.y);
   context.rotate(chicken.direction); // direction in radians
   context.beginPath();
   context.arc(0, 0, 20, 0, Math.PI*2); // body
   context.fillStyle = 'yellow';
   context.fill();
   context.beginPath();
   context.moveTo(0, -20); // beak
   context.lineTo(-10, 10);
   context.lineTo(10, 10);
   context.closePath();
   context.fillStyle = 'orange';
   context.fill();
   context.restore();

   Egg drawing:

   context.beginPath();
   context.ellipse(egg.x, egg.y, 10, 15, 0, 0, Math.PI*2);
   context.fillStyle = 'white';
   context.fill();

   Now, code structure:

   Inside the <script> tag.

   First, get the canvas and context.

   Create Chicken and Egg classes.

   Initialize variables:

   let canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
   let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

   class Chicken {
     constructor() {
       this.x = canvas.width / 2;
       this.y = canvas.height / 2;
       this.vx = 1; // initial velocity
       this.vy = 1;
       this.speed = 2; // pixels per second
       this.state = 'wandering';
       this.eggLayTimer = 5; // seconds
       this.layDuration = 1; // seconds
       this.direction = 0; // angle in radians
     }
     // methods to update position, check boundaries, etc.
   }

   class Egg {
     constructor(x, y, spawnTime) {
       this.x = x;
       this.y = y;
       this.spawnTime = spawnTime;
       this.lifespan = 10; // seconds
     }
   }

   let eggs = [];
   let chicken = new Chicken();
   let gameTime = 0;
   let lastFrameTime = 0;

   function update(deltaTime) {
     gameTime += deltaTime;

     // Update chicken's state
     if (chicken.state === 'laying') {
       chicken.layDuration -= deltaTime;
       if (chicken.layDuration <= 0) {
         // Lay egg
         let eggX = chicken.x - 10; // adjust based on direction
         let eggY = chicken.y;
         eggs.push(new Egg(eggX, eggY, gameTime));
         chicken.eggLayTimer = 5; // reset timer
         chicken.state = 'wandering';
         chicken.vx = 1; // reset velocity (or random direction?)
       }
     } else {
       chicken.eggLayTimer -= deltaTime;
       if (chicken.eggLayTimer <= 0) {
         // Start laying
         chicken.state = 'laying';
         // Set velocity to zero
         chicken.vx = 0;
         chicken.vy = 0;
       }
     }

     // Update position if not laying
     if (chicken.state === 'wandering') {
       // Move based on velocity
       chicken.x += chicken.vx * deltaTime * chicken.speed;
       chicken.y += chicken.vy * deltaTime * chicken.speed;

       // Boundary check
       if (chicken.x < 0 || chicken.x > canvas.width) {
         chicken.vx *= -1;
       }
       if (chicken.y < 0 || chicken.y > canvas.height) {
         chicken.vy *= -1;
       }

       // Random direction change
       if (Math.random() < 0.05) { // 5% chance per second
         // Set new random direction
         let angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
         chicken.vx = Math.cos(angle);
         chicken.vy = Math.sin(angle);
       }
     }

     // Remove expired eggs
     eggs = eggs.filter(egg => gameTime - egg.spawnTime < egg.lifespan);
   }

   function draw() {
     ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

     // Draw chicken
     ctx.save();
     ctx.translate(chicken.x, chicken.y);
     ctx.rotate(chicken.direction); // need to set direction based on velocity
     ctx.beginPath();
     ctx.arc(0, 0, 20, 0, Math.PI*2);
     ctx.fillStyle = 'yellow';
     ctx.fill();
     ctx.beginPath();
     ctx.moveTo(0, -20);
     ctx.lineTo(-10, 10);
     ctx.lineTo(10, 10);
     ctx.closePath();
     ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
     ctx.fill();
     ctx.restore();

     // Draw eggs
     eggs.forEach(egg => {
       ctx.beginPath();
       ctx.ellipse(egg.x, egg.y, 10, 15, 0, 0, Math.PI*2);
       ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
       ctx.fill();
     });
   }

   function animationLoop(time) {
     let deltaTime = (time - lastFrameTime) / 1000; // convert to seconds
     lastFrameTime = time;

     update(deltaTime);
     draw();

     requestAnimationFrame(animationLoop);
   }

   // Start the simulation
   lastFrameTime = performance.now();
   requestAnimationFrame(animationLoop);

   But wait, there are a few issues here:

   - The chicken's direction (angle) isn't being calculated correctly. Currently, the velocity components are used, but the direction (angle) is hard-coded to zero. So when the chicken changes direction, the beak doesn't point in the new direction.

   - Need to calculate the direction based on the velocity components. For example, direction = Math.atan2(vy, vx).

   - Also, the velocity components (vx, vy) need to be normalized to unit vector multiplied by speed. Otherwise, if the chicken changes direction, the speed might not be consistent.

   So, when changing direction, the chicken's vx and vy should be set to speed * cos(angle) and speed * sin(angle). So, for example, when the direction is random, we set:

   chicken.vx = chicken.speed * Math.cos(angle);
   chicken.vy = chicken.speed * Math.sin(angle);

   Then, the direction (angle) can be calculated as Math.atan2(vy, vx).

   So in the Chicken class, add a direction property which is updated whenever the velocity changes.

   So, in the Chicken class:

   class Chicken {
     constructor() {
       this.x = canvas.width / 2;
       this.y = canvas.height / 2;
       this.vx = 1;
       this.vy = 0;
       this.speed = 2;
       this.state = 'wandering';
       this.eggLayTimer = 5;
       this.layDuration = 1;
       this.direction = Math.atan2(this.vy, this.vx); // initial direction
     }

     // Method to update direction when velocity changes
     updateDirection() {
       this.direction = Math.atan2(this.vy, this.vx);
     }
   }

   Then, whenever vx or vy changes, call updateDirection().

   For example, when setting a new random direction:

   let angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
   chicken.vx = Math.cos(angle) * chicken.speed;
   chicken.vy = Math.sin(angle) * chicken.speed;
   chicken.updateDirection();

   Also, when bouncing off walls, the velocity components are reversed. So, after reversing, call updateDirection().

   So, in the update function, after handling boundaries:

   if (chicken.x < 0 || chicken.x > canvas.width) {
     chicken.vx *= -1;
     chicken.updateDirection();
   }
   if (chicken.y < 0 || chicken.y > canvas.height) {
     chicken.vy *= -1;
     chicken.updateDirection();
   }

   That way, the direction is always correct.

   Now, the chicken's beak will point in the direction of movement.

   Another thing: the egg's position should be adjusted based on the chicken's direction. For example, if the chicken is moving right, the egg is placed 10 pixels to the left of the chicken's center. If moving left, to the right. Similarly for up and down.

   So, the egg's position can be calculated as:

   let offsetX = 10 * Math.cos(chicken.direction + Math.PI); // opposite direction
   let offsetY = 10 * Math.sin(chicken.direction + Math.PI);
   let eggX = chicken.x + offsetX;
   let eggY = chicken.y + offsetY;

   Because adding Math.PI to the direction reverses it.

   So, when laying the egg:

   let eggX = chicken.x + 10 * Math.cos(chicken.direction + Math.PI);
   let eggY = chicken.y + 10 * Math.sin(chicken.direction + Math.PI);

   This ensures the egg is placed in the direction opposite to the chicken's movement, so it looks like it's laid behind.

   Also, during the laying state, the chicken's velocity should be zero, so it doesn't move while laying.

   Now, testing the code.

   Potential issues:

   - The chicken might get stuck if the direction change is too frequent. Maybe adjust the random chance.

   - The egg's lifespan is in seconds, but the code uses gameTime, which is in seconds. The filter function checks if gameTime - egg.spawnTime < egg.lifespan.

   - The egg's ellipse parameters (10,15) make it oval, which looks like an egg.

   - The chicken's beak is a triangle, which should be visible. The beak is drawn with context.moveTo(0, -20), which is pointing upwards, but when rotated, it should point in the direction.

   For example, when the chicken is facing right, the beak should point to the right. The current code uses translate and rotate, so the beak is drawn relative to the chicken's position and direction.

   So, the beak is always pointing in the direction of the chicken's movement.

   Another possible enhancement: when laying, the chicken's color changes briefly. For example, during the layDuration, the chicken's body is a different color. So in the draw function, check if the chicken is laying and change the fillStyle accordingly.

   So, in the draw function:

   if (chicken.state === 'laying') {
     ctx.fillStyle = 'pink';
   } else {
     ctx.fillStyle = 'yellow';
   }

   Similarly for the beak color.

   Also, when the chicken is laying, it doesn't move, so the velocity is zero. But in the code, when the state is 'laying', the velocity is set to zero. However, in the current code, when entering the laying state, the velocity is set to zero. But when exiting, it's not reset. Wait, no: in the update function, when the laying state is done, the code resets the eggLayTimer and sets the state back to wandering. But the velocity isn't reset. So the chicken's velocity might be zero after laying. Need to set a new random direction after laying.

   So, after laying, in the code:

   chicken.eggLayTimer = 5; // reset timer
   chicken.state = 'wandering';
   // Set new random direction
   let angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
   chicken.vx = Math.cos(angle) * chicken.speed;
   chicken.vy = Math.sin(angle) * chicken.speed;
   chicken.updateDirection();

   That way, after laying, the chicken resumes moving in a new random direction.

   Now, putting it all together.

   The Chicken class might need to have the updateDirection method. Or, maybe when the velocity changes, the direction is automatically updated.

   Alternatively, in the update function, after setting vx and vy, call updateDirection.

   Also, when reversing direction on collision, the direction is updated.

   This should make the chicken's beak always point in the correct direction.

   Another thing: the initial velocity in the Chicken constructor is (1, 0), which is right direction. But when the chicken starts, it should have a random direction. So in the constructor, set a random direction.

   So, in the Chicken constructor:

   let angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
   this.vx = Math.cos(angle) * this.speed;
   this.vy = Math.sin(angle) * this.speed;
   this.updateDirection();

   That way, the chicken starts moving in a random direction.

   Now, putting all this into code.

   Also, the chicken's position update: when moving, the new position is x += vx * deltaTime * speed. Wait, no: deltaTime is in seconds. The speed is pixels per second. So the movement per frame is vx * speed * deltaTime (since vx is a unit vector, multiplied by speed gives velocity in pixels per second). So yes, the code is correct.

   Testing the code:

   - The chicken starts in the middle, moves in a random direction.

   - Periodically, it stops, lays an egg, then resumes moving in a new direction.

   - Eggs stay for 10 seconds, then disappear.

   - The chicken's beak points in the direction of movement.

   - The chicken doesn't go outside the canvas.

   Potential issues:

   - The egg's position might be inside the chicken's body. Adjust the offset. Maybe 15 pixels behind.

   - The egg's lifespan might be too long or short.

   - The laying duration might be too short, making it hard to see the chicken laying.

   For the offset, maybe 15 pixels:

   let offset = 15;
   let eggX = chicken.x + offset * Math.cos(chicken.direction + Math.PI);
   let eggY = chicken.y + offset * Math.sin(chicken.direction + Math.PI);

   Also, during the laying state, the chicken's color changes to indicate laying.

   Now, code:

   Let's structure the code properly.

   HTML:

   The provided boilerplate is okay.

   JS:

   First, get the canvas and context.

   Create Chicken and Egg classes.

   Then, the animation loop.

   Now, code:

   <script>
     const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
     const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

     class Chicken {
       constructor() {
         this.x = canvas.width / 2;
         this.y = canvas.height / 2;
         this.vx = Math.cos(Math.random() * Math.PI * 2);
         this.vy = Math.sin(Math.random() * Math.PI * 2);
         this.speed = 50; // pixels per second
         this.state = 'wandering';
         this.eggLayTimer = 5; // seconds
         this.layDuration = 1; // seconds
         this.updateDirection();
       }

       updateDirection() {
         this.direction = Math.atan2(this.vy, this.vx);
       }
     }

           chicken.updateDirection();
         }
       } else {
         chicken.eggLayTimer -= deltaTime;
         if (chicken.eggLayTimer <= 0) {

         }
       }

       // Update position if not laying
       if (chicken.state === 'wandering') {
         // Move based on velocity

         chicken.y += chicken.vy * deltaTime * chicken.speed;

         // Boundary check

       }

       eggs = eggs.filter(egg => gameTime - egg.spawnTime < egg.lifespan);
     }

     function draw() {
       ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

       // Draw chicken
       ctx.save();
       ctx.translate(chicken.x, chicken.y);
       ctx.rotate(chicken.direction);
       ctx.beginPath();
       ctx.arc(0, 0, 20, 0, Math.PI*2);
       ctx.fillStyle = chicken.state === 'laying' ? 'pink' : 'yellow';
       ctx.fill();
       ctx.beginPath();
       ctx.moveTo(0, -20);
       ctx.lineTo(-10, 10);
       ctx.lineTo(10, 10);
       ctx.closePath();
       ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
       ctx.fill();
       ctx.restore();

       // Draw eggs
       eggs.forEach(egg => {
         ctx.beginPath();
         ctx.ellipse(egg.x, egg.y, 10, 15, 0, 0, Math.PI*2);
         ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
         ctx.fill();
       });
     }

     function animationLoop(time) {
       const deltaTime = (time - lastFrameTime) / 1000; // seconds
       lastFrameTime = time;

       update(deltaTime);
       draw();

       requestAnimationFrame(animationLoop);
     }

     // Start the simulation
     lastFrameTime = performance.now();
     requestAnimationFrame(animationLoop);
   </script>

   This should work. Now, check for any errors.

   For example, in the Chicken constructor:

   this.vx and vy are set to unit vectors, then multiplied by speed when moving. Wait, no: in the code, when moving, the velocity is vx * deltaTime * speed. But vx is a unit vector (since Math.cos(angle) gives between -1 and 1). So the speed is in pixels per second.

   So the movement is:

   chicken.x += vx * deltaTime * speed; // vx is a unit vector (cos(angle)), multiplied by speed to get pixels per second.

   Yes, that's correct. So, the speed is 50 pixels per second. So if deltaTime is 0.016 seconds (60 fps), the movement is 0.8 pixels per frame.

   Also, when the chicken changes direction, the vx and vy are set to cos(angle) and sin(angle), which are unit vectors. Then multiplied by speed during movement.

   So the code is correct.

   The egg's position is offset by 15 pixels in the direction opposite to the chicken's direction. So if the chicken is moving right, the egg is placed 15 pixels to the left.

   The chicken's color changes to pink when laying, which is a visual cue.

   The boundary handling reverses the velocity component when hitting the edge, and updates the direction.

   The random direction change is based on a probability of 5% per second. So per frame, the chance is 5% * deltaTime. For example, if deltaTime is 0.016 seconds, the chance is 0.0008, which is about 0.08% per frame, leading to about 5% per second.

   Now, this should satisfy the requirements.

   Desirable features:

   - Use classes for Chicken and Egg: done.

   - Orient chicken's visual to direction: done.

   - Slightly varied wandering behavior: implemented with random direction changes.

   - Visual cue when laying (color change): done.

   - Egg appears behind chicken: done.

   Now, testing the code:

   When the simulation runs, the chicken should move around, periodically stop to lay an egg (turning pink), then continue. Eggs remain on screen for 10 seconds.

   Potential issues:

   - The chicken might lay eggs too frequently. The lay interval is 5 seconds. So every 5 seconds, it lays an egg. That's a lot. Maybe increase the lay interval to 10 seconds.

   - The egg's lifespan is 10 seconds, which is same as lay interval. Maybe increase to 20 seconds.

   - The chicken's speed might be too fast, making it hard to see the eggs. Maybe reduce the speed to 20 pixels per second.

   Adjusting these values:

   In the Chicken constructor:

   this.speed = 20;

   chicken.eggLayTimer = 10;

   Egg lifespan:

   this.lifespan = 20;

   Also, in the code where the egg is laid:

   chicken.eggLayTimer = 10;

   Now, the chicken lays an egg every 10 seconds, and eggs stay for 20 seconds.

   This makes the simulation more manageable.

   So updating the code:

   class Chicken {
     constructor() {
       ...
       this.eggLayTimer = 10; // seconds
       ...
     }
     ...
   }

   class Egg {
     constructor(x, y, spawnTime) {
       ...
       this.lifespan = 20; // seconds
     }
   }

   Also, in the laying code:

   chicken.eggLayTimer = 10;

   Now, the chicken lays every 10 seconds.

   Another adjustment: the chicken's beak is a bit small. Maybe make it longer.

   In the chicken's beak drawing:

   ctx.moveTo(0, -30); // longer beak
   ctx.lineTo(-15, 15);
   ctx.lineTo(15, 15);
   ctx.closePath();

   So the beak extends 30 pixels up, and 15 pixels to the sides.

   Also, the body size could be increased to 25 pixels radius.

   So:

   ctx.arc(0, 0, 25, 0, Math.PI*2);

   This makes the chicken larger and the beak more prominent.

   Now, updating the draw function:

   // Draw chicken
   ctx.save();
   ctx.translate(chicken.x, chicken.y);
   ctx.rotate(chicken.direction);
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.arc(0, 0, 25, 0, Math.PI*2);
   ctx.fillStyle = chicken.state === 'laying' ? 'pink' : 'yellow';
   ctx.fill();
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.moveTo(0, -30);
   ctx.lineTo(-15, 15);
   ctx.lineTo(15, 15);
   ctx.closePath();
   ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
   ctx.fill();
   ctx.restore();

   This makes the chicken more visible and the beak longer.

   Now, the code should look better.

   Also, the egg's size can be adjusted. Maybe 12x18 pixels.

   In the egg drawing:

   ctx.ellipse(egg.x, egg.y, 12, 18, 0, 0, Math.PI*2);

   Now, putting all these changes into the code.

   After these adjustments, the simulation should be more visually appealing and meet the requirements.

This implementation meets all requirements:

1. **Object Management**: Uses classes for `Chicken` and `Egg` with properties like position, velocity, and state.
2. **Chicken Behavior**: Implements wandering with random direction changes, boundary handling, and periodic egg-laying with visual cues.
3. **Egg Management**: Eggs are stored in an array and removed after their lifespan expires.
4. **Animation Loop**: Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` with delta time for smooth updates.
5. **Visuals**: Chicken and eggs are drawn using canvas API with appropriate shapes and orientations.

The simulation runs autonomously, with the chicken moving and laying eggs, providing a charming visual of "Happy Mrs. Chicken" in action.
