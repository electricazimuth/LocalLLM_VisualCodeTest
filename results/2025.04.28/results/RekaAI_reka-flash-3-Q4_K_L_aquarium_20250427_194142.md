I need to create an aquarium simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's break down the requirements and think about how to approach each part.

First, the main goal is to have multiple fish swimming autonomously. So, I'll need to manage multiple fish objects. Each fish should have properties like position, velocity, size, color, and shape. Maybe I can create a Fish class to encapsulate these properties and behaviors.

The HTML structure is given, so I'll start by setting up the canvas element. The CSS styles the body and canvas, which is good. The canvas has a light blue background to simulate water.

Next, the Fish class. Each fish needs to have a position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), size, color, and a method to draw itself. The velocity can be based on speed and direction. For movement, I'll use a wandering behavior where the fish changes direction gradually. Also, they need to bounce off the edges smoothly.

For the wandering behavior, I can add a small random change to the direction over time. Maybe using a steering force towards a random point periodically. That would make their movement more natural.

Boundary detection is important. When a fish approaches the edge, it should turn towards the center. So, if the fish is near the top or bottom, it should swim upwards or downwards, respectively. Similarly for left and right edges.

The animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame. I'll need to calculate deltaTime to make the movement frame-rate independent. In each frame, update all fish positions, handle their movements and boundary checks, then redraw them.

To draw the fish, I can use basic shapes like ovals and triangles. The fish should face the direction it's moving. To orient the fish, I can calculate the angle from the velocity components and rotate the canvas when drawing.

For variation, each fish can have different sizes, colors, and speeds. I'll initialize them with random positions, colors, and sizes within certain ranges.

Now, putting it all together. The main steps are:

1. Create the Fish class with the required properties and methods.
2. Initialize multiple fish instances with random attributes.
3. Set up the animation loop (gameLoop) that updates each fish's state and redraws them.
4. Handle boundary interactions by adjusting velocity when near edges.
5. Implement the wandering behavior to change direction over time.
6. Draw each fish with correct orientation and rotation.

Testing each part step by step. For example, check if fish move correctly, change direction, and bounce off edges. Also, ensure the animation is smooth across different frame rates.

Possible issues to watch out for: making sure the delta time is correctly calculated, especially if the loop runs slower. Also, when rotating the canvas to draw the fish, don't forget to reset the transform after drawing each fish to avoid cumulative rotations.

Another thing is to vary the fish's appearance. Using different colors and sizes makes the simulation more realistic. Maybe randomize the hue for color and size between certain values.

For the wandering behavior, using a small angular velocity that changes direction randomly over time. This creates a more natural drift instead of sudden direction changes.

In the game loop, clear the canvas each frame with the background color. Then, for each fish, update their position based on velocity, check boundaries, apply wandering, then draw them.

I think that covers the main parts. Now, time to code this step by step.

This implementation features:

1. **Object-Oriented Structure**:
   - `Fish` class handles individual fish behavior and rendering
   - `Aquarium` class manages fish population and animation loop

2. **Natural Movement**:
   - Wandering behavior with random directional changes
   - Smooth boundary handling that turns fish towards center
   - Size and color variation for different fish

3. **Physics Simulation**:
   - Frame-rate independent updates using deltaTime
   - Position updates based on velocity and direction
   - Boundary detection and response

4. **Visual Design**:
   - Detailed fish graphics with body, tail, and eye
   - Rotated drawing based on movement direction
   - Underwater background and lighting effects

5. **Performance**:
   - Efficient canvas operations
   - Proper state management using save/restore transforms
   - Optimized update/draw cycle

The simulation will show multiple fish with varying appearances moving in organic patterns while maintaining within the canvas boundaries. Each fish has a unique color and size, and their movement appears more natural due to the combination of wandering behavior and boundary interactions.
