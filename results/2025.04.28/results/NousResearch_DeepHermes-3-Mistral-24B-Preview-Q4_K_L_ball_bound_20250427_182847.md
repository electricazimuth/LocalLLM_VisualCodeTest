Okay, I need to create a bouncing balls simulation using HTML, JS, and CSS. Let's start by breaking down the requirements. The main components are the HTML setup with a canvas, JavaScript for physics and animation, and CSS for styling. 

First, the HTML part. The provided boilerplate has a canvas with id 'gameCanvas', width 800, height 600. The CSS is already set up with a body margin of 0 and overflow hidden. The canvas has a border and white background. That's good, so I'll use this as is.

Now, the JS part. The goal is to simulate 50+ balls with gravity, damping, and collisions. Let's think about how to structure this.

Each ball needs to be an object with properties: position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), radius, mass, and color. Maybe a Ball class would be good here. Then, an array to hold all the balls.

Initialization: Create 50 balls. Each should have random positions within the canvas boundaries. But how to prevent initial overlaps? Maybe check if a new ball overlaps with existing ones and regenerate until it's okay. But since the requirement says it's not the primary focus, maybe just random positions with a check for overlaps. But if overlaps happen, the collision detection will handle it.

Physics update per frame: Clear the canvas, apply gravity, update positions, check wall collisions, check ball collisions, then draw.

Gravity: Each frame, add gravity to vy. Let's say gravity is 0.2 pixels per frame squared? Or maybe 0.1, depending on the desired effect.

Wall collisions: Check if a ball's position plus radius is beyond the canvas edges. If so, reverse velocity and apply damping. Also, correct the position to inside the boundary. For example, if the ball's top is above the canvas, reverse vy and adjust y to the top edge plus radius.

Ball collisions: For each pair of balls, check if the distance between centers is less than the sum of radii. If so, handle the collision. The response should prevent overlap and have them bounce. The exact physics here is a bit tricky. The user mentioned that a plausible approximation is acceptable. Maybe using a simple approach where the balls reverse their velocities along the collision axis. But this might not conserve momentum correctly. Alternatively, calculate the collision response based on masses and velocities. Maybe using the formula for elastic collisions in 2D. But that's more complex.

Optimization for collision detection: Since O(n^2) is slow for 50 balls, need a spatial partitioning method. Quadtree or grid-based approach. Let's think about a grid. Divide the canvas into cells. Check collisions only between balls in the same cell and adjacent cells. That reduces the number of checks.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define Ball class with x, y, vx, vy, r, mass, color.
2. Initialize array of balls with random positions and velocities.
3. Animation loop using requestAnimationFrame.
4. Each frame: clear canvas, apply gravity, update positions, check wall collisions, check ball collisions, draw.

For wall collisions:

For each ball:
Check if x < r or x > W - r: reverse vx, apply damping, adjust x.
Check if y < r or y > H - r: reverse vy, apply damping, adjust y.

For ball collisions:

Loop through each pair (i, j) where i < j. For each pair, calculate distance. If distance <= r1 + r2, then handle collision.

Collision response: The exact calculation is needed. Let's recall that in elastic collisions, the velocities are exchanged along the normal. The formula involves the relative velocity, normal vector, and masses. But for simplicity, maybe use a method where the balls exchange velocities along the collision axis, scaled by their masses. Or perhaps a more accurate approach.

But given time constraints, maybe implement a simple approach where the balls reverse their velocities if they overlap. But that's not correct. Alternatively, use the following steps for collision response:

- Calculate the normal vector between the two balls.
- Calculate the relative velocity.
- The impulse is based on the relative velocity and masses.
- Update velocities accordingly.

But this is complex. Alternatively, a simpler approach: for each colliding pair, swap their velocities along the collision axis. But this might not conserve momentum. Alternatively, use the formula for 1D elastic collision and extend to 2D. Let's look up the formula for 2D elastic collision.

The correct way involves calculating the unit vector between the centers, the relative velocity, and then updating the velocities based on the coefficient of restitution. But damping is applied in wall collisions, so maybe use a similar approach here.

Alternatively, here's a method:

1. Calculate the collision normal (unit vector from ball1 to ball2).
2. Calculate the relative velocity in the normal direction.
3. If the relative velocity is positive (moving apart), no collision.
4. Otherwise, calculate the impulse based on the masses and relative velocity.
5. Update the velocities of both balls.

But this might be too complex. Alternatively, use a simpler approach where the balls exchange velocities along the collision axis. Let's see.

But for the sake of time, maybe implement a simple collision handling where the balls are moved apart along the normal, and their velocities are adjusted. The exact physics isn't perfect, but it's functional.

So, for each colliding pair:

- Calculate the overlap vector.
- Move each ball away by half the overlap.
- Calculate the collision normal.
- Compute the relative velocity in the normal direction.
- Apply damping to the velocities (multiply by damping factor).
- Reverse the normal component of their velocities.

But need to test this.

Alternatively, use the following steps for collision response:

For balls i and j:

- dx = xi - xj
- dy = yi - yj
- distance = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)
- if distance > r1 + r2, no collision.

If collision:

- Compute overlap = (r1 + r2 - distance)
- Compute unit vector u = (dx, dy) / distance
- Move each ball along the unit vector by half the overlap.
- Then, compute the relative velocity.
- Apply damping to the velocities.
- Reverse the velocity components along the collision normal.

But how to reverse the velocities along the normal? Maybe decompose each ball's velocity into normal and tangential components. Then, reverse the normal components and apply damping.

Alternatively, here's a simplified approach:

For each colliding pair, calculate the collision normal. Then, for each ball, reverse the component of their velocity in the direction of the normal, multiply by damping factor.

For example:

normalVector = (dx, dy).normalize()

v1_normal = (v1 . normalVector)
v2_normal = (v2 . normalVector)

Then, reverse these components (with damping):

v1_normal = -v1_normal * dampingFactor
v2_normal = -v2_normal * dampingFactor

But this might not conserve momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the formula for elastic collision in 2D. The formula is:

v1' = v1 - (2*m2/(m1+m2)) * (v1 - v2) * dot(normal, v1 - v2) * normal

But this requires vector math.

This is getting complicated. Maybe refer to some collision response algorithms.

Alternatively, here's a simpler approach inspired by 1D collisions but extended to 2D:

For each colliding pair:

1. Calculate the relative velocity in the direction of the collision normal.
2. If the relative velocity is positive (moving apart), no collision.
3. Otherwise, compute the impulse needed to separate the balls.
4. Update each ball's velocity based on the impulse.

The impulse is calculated as:

impulse = ( (1 + e) * (v1 - v2) . normal ) / (1/m1 + 1/m2 )

Where e is the coefficient of restitution (damping factor).

But since we want damping, e is less than 1. For example, e=0.8.

Then, the change in velocity is:

delta_v1 = (impulse / m1) * normal
delta_v2 = (impulse / m2) * normal

But this might be a correct approach. However, implementing this correctly requires vector math.

Alternatively, perhaps use a simplified version where the balls exchange velocities along the normal, scaled by their masses. For example:

v1_new = (2*m2/(m1 + m2)) * (v2 . normal) * normal - v1 . normal * normal + v1
v2_new = (2*m1/(m1 + m2)) * (v1 . normal) * normal - v2 . normal * normal + v2

But this is just a guess. I might need to look up the correct formula.

Alternatively, here's a resource: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/physics/VectorMaths.html

According to this, for elastic collision in 2D, the formula is:

v1' = v1 - (2 * m2 / (m1 + m2)) * (v1 - v2) . n * n

v2' = v2 + (2 * m1 / (m1 + m2)) * (v1 - v2) . n * n

Where n is the collision normal.

But this assumes perfect elasticity. To add damping, we can multiply the relative velocity by the coefficient of restitution (e) before applying the impulse.

So the formula becomes:

v1' = v1 - (e * (2 * m2 / (m1 + m2)) * (v1 - v2) . n * n )

v2' = v2 + (e * (2 * m1 / (m1 + m2)) * (v1 - v2) . n * n )

But I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, the impulse calculation should include the coefficient of restitution.

The correct approach is to calculate the impulse as:

impulse = ( (e + 1) * (v1 - v2) . n ) / (1/m1 + 1/m2 )

Then, apply the impulse to both balls:

v1' = v1 - impulse / m1 * n

v2' = v2 + impulse / m2 * n

Yes, this seems correct. So, the steps are:

1. Calculate the normal vector between the centers (n = (dx, dy).normalize()).
2. Calculate the relative velocity in the normal direction: v_rel = (v1 - v2) . n
3. If v_rel > 0, no collision (moving apart).
4. Else, calculate the impulse.
5. Apply impulse to both velocities.

This should handle the collision response correctly. Let's try to implement this.

So, for each colliding pair:

- Calculate dx and dy between centers.
- Compute distance. If distance > sum of radii, skip.
- Compute overlap = (r1 + r2 - distance)
- Move each ball along the normal by half the overlap.
- Compute the collision normal (unit vector).
- Compute relative velocity in normal direction.
- If relative velocity is positive (moving apart), no collision.
- Else, compute impulse.
- Apply impulse to both balls' velocities.

Additionally, apply damping by multiplying the impulse by a damping factor (e.g., 0.8 or 0.9). So, the impulse is impulse *= dampingFactor.

Now, for the spatial partitioning to optimize collision detection. Let's use a grid-based approach. Divide the canvas into cells. Each cell is a certain size, say 100x100 pixels. Then, for each ball, determine which cell(s) it belongs to. Then, check collisions only between balls in the same cell and adjacent cells. This reduces the number of checks.

Implementing a grid:

1. Determine the number of cells per row and column based on canvas dimensions and cell size.
2. For each ball, calculate which cells it occupies (since a ball can span multiple cells if its radius is large).
3. For each cell, store a list of balls in it.
4. For collision detection, iterate through each cell, and for each pair of balls in the same cell or adjacent cells, check for collision.

This approach reduces the number of checks from O(n^2) to O(n) if the grid is efficient.

So, the steps for collision detection would be:

- Update the grid: clear the grid, then for each ball, add it to the appropriate cells.
- Iterate through each cell in the grid.
- For each pair of balls in the same cell and adjacent cells, check for collision.

Now, implementing the grid. Let's say the cell size is 100x100. Then, the number of cells per row is W / 100, per column H / 100. But need to handle integer division. For example, if W is 800, then 8 cells per row. Similarly for H 600, 6 cells per column. So grid is 8x6.

Each cell is stored in a 2D array. For each ball, calculate the min and max cell indices it occupies. For example, a ball with x=50, radius=50 would occupy cells from x=0 to x=1 (assuming cell size 100). But since the ball's position is (x,y), and radius r, the cells it occupies are from floor((x - r)/cellWidth) to ceil((x + r)/cellWidth), same for y.

Once the grid is built, for each cell, check collisions with balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

This is a common optimization technique.

Now, putting it all together.

First, the Ball class:

class Ball {
  constructor(x, y, r, color) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
    this.vx = 0;
    this.vy = 0;
    this.mass = r * r; // or a constant
    this.color = color;
  }
}

Then, initializing 50 balls:

const balls = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
  let x = Math.random() * (W - 2 * minRadius) + minRadius;
  let y = Math.random() * (H - 2 * minRadius) + minRadius;
  let r = Math.random() * (maxRadius - minRadius) + minRadius;
  let color = getRandomColor();
  balls.push(new Ball(x, y, r, color));
}

But need to ensure that initial velocities are random. Maybe add some initial velocity.

Then, the animation loop.

In the loop:

- Clear canvas.
- Apply gravity to each ball: vy += gravity.
- Update positions: x += vx, y += vy.
- Handle wall collisions.
- Handle ball collisions (using grid-based approach).
- Draw each ball.

For wall collisions:

function handleWallCollisions(ball) {
  if (ball.x - ball.r < 0 || ball.x + ball.r > W) {
    ball.vx = -ball.vx * dampingFactor;
    if (ball.x - ball.r < 0) {
      ball.x = ball.r;
    } else {
      ball.x = W - ball.r;
    }
  }
  if (ball.y - ball.r < 0 || ball.y + ball.r > H) {
    ball.vy = -ball.vy * dampingFactor;
    if (ball.y - ball.r < 0) {
      ball.y = ball.r;
    } else {
      ball.y = H - ball.r;
    }
  }
}

But damping is applied here. The damping factor is, say, 0.9.

For ball collisions, need to implement the grid-based approach.

Implementing the grid:

const cellSize = 100;
const numCols = Math.ceil(W / cellSize);
const numRows = Math.ceil(H / cellSize);
const grid = Array(numCols).fill().map(() => Array(numRows).fill([]));

function getCells(ball) {
  const minX = Math.floor((ball.x - ball.r) / cellSize);
  const maxX = Math.floor((ball.x + ball.r) / cellSize);
  const minY = Math.floor((ball.y - ball.r) / cellSize);
  const maxY = Math.floor((ball.y + ball.r) / cellSize);
  const cells = [];
  for (let x = minX; x <= maxX; x++) {
    for (let y = minY; y <= maxY; y++) {
      if (x >= 0 && x < numCols && y >= 0 && y < numRows) {
        cells.push({ x, y });
      }
    }
  }
  return cells;
}

function updateGrid(balls) {
  grid.forEach(row => row.fill([]));
  for (const ball of balls) {
    const cells = getCells(ball);
    for (const { x, y } of cells) {
      grid[x][y].push(ball);
    }
  }
}

Then, for collision detection:

function detectCollisions() {
  for (let x = 0; x < numCols; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < numRows; y++) {
      for (const ball1 of grid[x][y]) {
        for (const ball2 of grid[x][y]) {
          if (ball1 === ball2) continue;
          checkCollision(ball1, ball2);
        }
        // Check adjacent cells
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}

But this is incomplete. Also, need to check adjacent cells. For each cell, check the current cell and the 8 adjacent cells (if they exist). Then, for each pair of balls in those cells, check for collision.

But this is getting complex. Alternatively, precompute all adjacent cells and iterate through them.

Alternatively, in the collision detection loop, for each cell (x, y), check all 9 cells (including itself and 8 adjacent) that are within the grid. For each of those cells, check all pairs of balls between the current cell and the adjacent cell.

But this could be optimized by precomputing the adjacent cell indices and iterating through them.

Alternatively, for each cell (x, y), generate all the cells in the 3x3 neighborhood (including self) and check all pairs of balls in those cells.

But this might be too slow. Let's think of a way to iterate through all possible cell pairs within the 3x3 neighborhood.

Alternatively, for each cell (x, y), iterate through all cells in the range x-1 to x+1, y-1 to y+1, and for each of those cells, check all pairs between balls in the current cell and balls in the adjacent cell.

But this is O(n) for each cell, where n is the average number of balls per cell. For 50 balls, if each cell has about 1 ball, then it's manageable.

So, the detectCollisions function would look like:

function detectCollisions() {
  for (let x = 0; x < numCols; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < numRows; y++) {
      const cell = grid[x][y];
      for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
        for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
          const nx = x + dx;
          const ny = y + dy;
          if (nx >= 0 && nx < numCols && ny >= 0 && ny < numRows) {
            const neighbor = grid[nx][ny];
            for (const ball1 of cell) {
              for (const ball2 of neighbor) {
                if (ball1 !== ball2) {
                  checkCollision(ball1, ball2);
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

But this would check all pairs in the 3x3 neighborhood, which might include duplicates. For example, cell (x,y) and cell (x+1,y) are both considered. So, when cell (x,y) is processed, it checks cell (x+1,y), and when cell (x+1,y) is processed, it checks cell (x,y). This could lead to checking the same pair twice. To prevent this, perhaps only check cells where dx and dy are non-positive, or use some other logic to avoid duplicate checks. Alternatively, accept the duplicate checks but it's not a big issue for performance.

But in the worst case, each pair is checked twice, but the collision check is O(1), so it's manageable.

Now, the checkCollision function:

function checkCollision(ball1, ball2) {
  const dx = ball1.x - ball2.x;
  const dy = ball1.y - ball2.y;
  const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  const sumRadii = ball1.r + ball2.r;
  if (distance <= sumRadii) {
    // Collision occurred
    const normalX = dx / distance;
    const normalY = dy / distance;
    const relativeVelocity = (ball1.vx - ball2.vx) * normalX + (ball1.vy - ball2.vy) * normalY;
    if (relativeVelocity > 0) return; // Moving apart

    // Calculate impulse
    const e = dampingFactor; // coefficient of restitution (damping)
    const impulse = (e * relativeVelocity) / (1/ball1.mass + 1/ball2.mass);

    // Apply impulse
    const j = impulse;
    const impulseX = j * normalX;
    const impulseY = j * normalY;
    ball1.vx -= impulseX / ball1.mass;
    ball1.vy -= impulseY / ball1.mass;
    ball2.vx += impulseX / ball2.mass;
    ball2.vy += impulseY / ball2.mass;

    // Move balls apart
    const overlap = sumRadii - distance;
    const moveX = overlap * normalX * 0.5;
    const moveY = overlap * normalY * 0.5;
    ball1.x -= moveX;
    ball1.y -= moveY;
    ball2.x += moveX;
    ball2.y += moveY;
  }
}

This function calculates the normal vector, checks the relative velocity, computes the impulse, applies it to both balls' velocities, and moves the balls apart.

Now, putting this all together.

The animation loop:

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);
  applyGravity();
  updatePositions();
  handleWallCollisions();
  updateGrid(balls);
  detectCollisions();
  drawBalls();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

But need to define the functions.

applyGravity: for each ball, vy += gravity.

updatePositions: for each ball, x += vx, y += vy.

handleWallCollisions: for each ball, check and reverse velocity, apply damping, adjust position.

updateGrid: as previously defined.

detectCollisions: as above.

drawBalls: for each ball, draw a filled circle.

Now, testing this code. Potential issues:

- Initial velocities might be zero, leading to all balls just falling. Need to give them random initial velocities.

In the Ball constructor, set vx and vy to random values. For example:

this.vx = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
this.vy = Math.random() * 2 - 1;

But this may be too small. Maybe multiply by a factor, like 2 or 5.

Another issue: the grid size. If the cell size is too large, balls in adjacent cells might not collide. If too small, the grid becomes large and slow. Need to experiment. Maybe cell size of 100 is okay for 800x600 canvas.

Another thing: the overlap correction after collision. The code moves the balls apart, but if they are moving towards each other, the next frame they might collide again. The collision detection and response should be accurate enough to prevent that, but with damping, velocities decrease, so collisions may become less frequent.

Testing this code in the browser would reveal any issues. For example, balls might stick together if the collision response isn't correct. Adjusting the damping factor and impulse calculation might help.

Another optimization: in the collision detection, if two balls are already in contact, check if they are moving towards or away. If moving away, no need to apply collision. This is handled in the relative velocity check.

Now, integrating all this into the provided HTML boilerplate.

The HTML is given, so just add the code inside the <script> tag.

Putting it all together:

First, the Ball class:

class Ball {
  constructor(x, y, r, color) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.r = r;
    this.vx = Math.random() * 4 - 2; // Random initial velocity
    this.vy = Math.random() * 4 - 2;
    this.mass = r * r; // mass proportional to radius squared
    this.color = color;
  }
}

Then, initializing the balls:

const numBalls = 50;
const minRadius = 10;
const maxRadius = 30;
const dampingFactor = 0.9;
const gravity = 0.2;

function getRandomColor() {
  const letters = '0123456789ABCDEF';
  let color = '#';
  for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)];
  }
  return color;
}

const balls = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numBalls; i++) {
  let x = Math.random() * (W - 2 * maxRadius) + maxRadius;
  let y = Math.random() * (H - 2 * maxRadius) + maxRadius;
  let r = Math.random() * (maxRadius - minRadius) + minRadius;
  let color = getRandomColor();
  balls.push(new Ball(x, y, r, color));
}

Then, the grid setup:

const cellSize = 100;
const numCols = Math.ceil(W / cellSize);
const numRows = Math.ceil(H / cellSize);
const grid = Array(numCols).fill().map(() => Array(numRows).fill([]));

function getCells(ball) {
  const minX = Math.floor((ball.x - ball.r) / cellSize);

  const minY = Math.floor((ball.y - ball.r) / cellSize);
  const maxY = Math.floor((ball.y + ball.r) / cellSize);
  const cells = [];
  for (let x = minX; x <= maxX; x++) {
    for (let y = minY; y <= maxY; y++) {
      if (x >= 0 && x < numCols && y >= 0 && y < numRows) {
        cells.push({ x, y });
      }
    }
  }
  return cells;
}

  }
}

Then, the physics functions:

  }
}

      if (ball.x - ball.r < 0) {
        ball.x = ball.r;
      } else {
        ball.x = W - ball.r;
      }
    }
    if (ball.y - ball.r < 0 || ball.y + ball.r > H) {
      ball.vy = -ball.vy * dampingFactor;
      if (ball.y - ball.r < 0) {
        ball.y = ball.r;
      } else {
        ball.y = H - ball.r;
      }
    }
  }
}

function checkCollision(ball1, ball2) {
  const dx = ball1.x - ball2.x;
  const dy = ball1.y - ball2.y;
  const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  const sumRadii = ball1.r + ball2.r;
  if (distance <= sumRadii) {
    const normalX = dx / distance;
    const normalY = dy / distance;
    const relativeVelocity = (ball1.vx - ball2.vx) * normalX + (ball1.vy - ball2.vy) * normalY;
    if (relativeVelocity > 0) return; // Moving apart

    // Calculate impulse
    const e = dampingFactor; // coefficient of restitution (damping)
    const impulse = (e * relativeVelocity) / (1/ball1.mass + 1/ball2.mass);

    // Apply impulse
    const j = impulse;
    const impulseX = j * normalX;
    const impulseY = j * normalY;
    ball1.vx -= impulseX / ball1.mass;
    ball1.vy -= impulseY / ball1.mass;
    ball2.vx += impulseX / ball2.mass;
    ball2.vy += impulseY / ball2.mass;

    // Move balls apart
    const overlap = sumRadii - distance;
    const moveX = overlap * normalX * 0.5;

    ball2.y += moveY;
  }
}

function detectCollisions() {

          const nx = x + dx;
          const ny = y + dy;
          if (nx >= 0 && nx < numCols && ny >= 0 && ny < numRows) {
            const neighbor = grid[nx][ny];
            for (const ball1 of cell) {
              for (const ball2 of neighbor) {
                if (ball1 !== ball2) {
                  checkCollision(ball1, ball2);
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

function drawBalls() {
  for (const ball of balls) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(ball.x, ball.y, ball.r, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fillStyle = ball.color;
    ctx.fill();
  }
}

Then, the game loop:

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);
  applyGravity();
  updatePositions();
  handleWallCollisions();
  updateGrid();
  detectCollisions();
  drawBalls();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

Finally, start the loop:

requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

Now, putting all this into the HTML boilerplate.

Testing this code should create a simulation with 50 balls bouncing around, colliding with walls and each other, with damping. The grid-based collision detection should handle the performance.

Potential issues to check:

- Balls might stick together if the collision response isn't correct. Adjusting the damping factor and impulse calculation might help.
- The grid size might need tuning. If the cell size is too large, collisions between balls in adjacent cells might not be detected. If too small, the grid becomes too big and slow. Experiment with cellSize values.
- The initial positions might have overlaps, but the collision detection will handle them.

Another thing to note: the mass is set as radius squared. This is a common approach to simulate mass. Alternatively, set all masses to a constant value, but radius squared is more realistic.

Also, the initial velocities are random. They might be too small, leading to balls just falling. Increasing the initial velocity range might make them move faster.

In the Ball constructor:

this.vx = Math.random() * 10 - 5;
this.vy = Math.random() * 10 - 5;

This gives a range of -5 to +5 pixels per frame, which should be noticeable.

Another optimization: in the collision detection, after handling a collision, mark the balls as checked to avoid redundant checks. But this might complicate the code and not significantly improve performance.

Overall, this should meet the requirements: 50 balls, gravity, wall collisions with damping, ball collisions with response, and grid-based optimization.

This code implements:

1. **HTML Setup**: Uses the provided skeleton with a canvas of 800x600.
2. **Canvas Rendering**: Draws balls as filled circles with varying radii and colors.
3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - **Ball Representation**: Uses a `Ball` class with position, velocity, radius, mass, and color.
   - **Initialization**: Creates 50 balls with random positions and velocities.
   - **Animation Loop**: Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation.
   - **Physics Update**: Applies gravity, updates positions, handles wall collisions with damping, and detects/interacts with ball collisions using a grid-based optimization.
4. **Collision Handling**: Implements elastic collisions with damping using impulse-based physics and grid partitioning for efficiency.

This should provide a functional and optimized bouncing balls simulation meeting all specified requirements.
