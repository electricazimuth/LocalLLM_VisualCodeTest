Okay, let's tackle this vehicle collision simulation. I need to break down the requirements and figure out how to approach each part step by step. Let's start by understanding all the components needed.

First, the main structure. The simulation will use HTML5 canvas for rendering. So I need to set up the canvas with a specific size, probably 512x512 as per the boilerplate. Then, in JavaScript, I'll manage the vehicles, their movements, collisions, explosions, and state transitions.

The vehicles need to be represented as objects. Each vehicle should have position, velocity, size, and a visual representation. For the visual, maybe a rectangle for the body and circles for wheels. But since it's a simple shape, maybe just a rectangle. Wait, the requirement says a simple visual, maybe a rectangle or circle. Let's go with a rectangle for the body and two circles for wheels. Hmm, but rendering that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe a square or rectangle for the entire vehicle. That could simplify things. Let's decide on a rectangle for the vehicle's body. Then, for collision detection, we can check if their bounding rectangles overlap.

Wait, collision detection can be done using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB). That's simpler than circles. So each vehicle's collision is a rectangle. So their position is the top-left corner, and they have width and height. Then, when checking collisions, we just check if their rectangles overlap.

Okay, so each Vehicle object will have x, y (position of top-left corner), vx, vy (velocity), width, height, and isActive. Also, a color or maybe a random color for each vehicle.

The explosion particles need to be created when two vehicles collide. Each particle has position, velocity (random outward direction), lifespan, size, and color. They should fade out as their lifespan decreases.

State management is crucial. The simulation has three states: RUNNING, EXPLODING, RESTARTING. During RUNNING, we update vehicles and check collisions. If a collision happens, switch to EXPLODING. In EXPLODING, update and draw particles until they all disappear. Then switch to RESTARTING, where we clean up and reinitialize vehicles before going back to RUNNING.

So, the animation loop will use requestAnimationFrame. Each frame, depending on the state, we perform different actions. For example, in RUNNING state, update vehicles, check collisions. In EXPLODING, update particles, check if all are gone. In RESTARTING, do cleanup and reinitialize.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Set up the canvas and get the context.
2. Create Vehicle class and ExplosionParticle class.
3. Initialize the simulation: create vehicles with random positions and velocities.
4. Implement the animation loop with requestAnimationFrame.
5. Handle movement and wrapping for vehicles.
6. Implement collision detection between vehicles.
7. On collision, trigger explosion: create particles, show "BOOM" text, then after a delay restart.
8. Manage state transitions between RUNNING, EXPLODING, RESTARTING.
9. Render vehicles, particles, and "BOOM" text accordingly.

Now, let's think about each part in more detail.

**Vehicle Class:**
- Position (x, y)
- Velocity (vx, vy)
- Size (width, height)
- Color (random or fixed)
- isActive (boolean)
- A method to update position based on velocity and delta time.
- A method to check if it's off-screen and wrap around.
- A method to render itself on the canvas.

**ExplosionParticle Class:**
- Position (x, y)
- Velocity (vx, vy)
- Lifespan (remaining time)
- Size (radius)
- Color
- A method to update position and decrease lifespan based on delta time.
- A method to render itself, maybe fading out by adjusting alpha.

**Collision Detection:**
Need to check all pairs of vehicles. But to optimize, we can use a nested loop but skip self-checks (i.e., i < j). For each pair, check if their AABBs overlap. The AABB check is simple: if vehicleA.x + vehicleA.width > vehicleB.x and vehicleB.x + vehicleB.width > vehicleA.x and vehicleA.y + vehicleA.height > vehicleB.y and vehicleB.y + vehicleB.height > vehicleA.y.

Once a collision is detected, mark both vehicles as inactive, calculate the collision point (maybe average of their positions), create explosion particles around that point, set state to EXPLODING, and start a timer to wait before restarting.

**Explosion Effect:**
When a collision happens, generate 15-30 particles. Each particle's position is the collision point. Velocity is random in all directions, maybe with some range. Lifespan is a few seconds (like 2-3 seconds). Each frame, their position is updated based on velocity. Size might decrease over time. Color can be white or random. Also, show "BOOM" text at the collision point, which expands and fades.

**State Management:**
- RUNNING: Update vehicles, check collisions. If collision, set state to EXPLODING.
- EXPLODING: Update particles, draw particles. If all particles are gone, set state to RESTARTING after a delay.
- RESTARTING: Wait for a few seconds, then reset vehicles and go back to RUNNING.

Wait, the requirement says after the explosion animation completes, the entire simulation resets and starts again. So after explosion particles are done, the simulation should restart. But the explosion state might need to wait for a few seconds (like 3-5) before restarting. Hmm, but the explosion particles might take 2-3 seconds to fade out. So the total time before restarting is the sum of the explosion duration and the delay.

Alternatively, the explosion state could handle both the particles and the delay. For example, in the EXPLODING state, particles are updated until they all die. Then, after that, the simulation enters RESTARTING state, which waits for 3-5 seconds before going back to RUNNING.

Wait, the requirement says "After the explosion animation completes, the entire simulation should reset and start again with a new set of vehicles." So the explosion animation is the particles, and after they are all gone, the simulation restarts. But maybe there's a delay before restarting. Let's clarify: when the explosion particles are all gone, the simulation should restart. So the RESTARTING state is just for cleanup and reinitialization, perhaps with a brief delay.

Wait, the requirement says: "Trigger an explosion... Wait for a few (3-5) seconds before restarting the simulation." So even if the explosion particles are gone, the simulation waits 3-5 seconds before restarting. So the RESTARTING state would have a timer. So the process is: collision → create particles → switch to EXPLODING state → update particles until they are all gone → then switch to RESTARTING state → wait 3-5 seconds → reset vehicles and go back to RUNNING.

So the state transitions would be:

RUNNING → EXPLODING (on collision)
EXPLODING → RESTARTING (when all particles are gone)
RESTARTING → RUNNING (after a delay)

So in the EXPLODING state, we update particles and check if any are left. Once none are left, switch to RESTARTING. Then, in RESTARTING, we start a timer for 3-5 seconds, and after that, reset vehicles and go back to RUNNING.

How to manage this? Maybe in the RESTARTING state, we start a timeout that, when expires, resets the vehicles and switches back to RUNNING.

Now, for the code structure:

The main loop is driven by requestAnimationFrame. Each frame, based on the state, perform different actions.

For the vehicle movement:

Each frame, update their position based on velocity * deltaTime. Check if they've gone off-screen. If so, wrap them to the opposite edge. For example, if a vehicle's x < 0, set x to canvas width. Similarly for other edges.

Collision detection: loop through all vehicles, for each pair, check if their AABBs overlap. If so, mark them as inactive, calculate collision point, create explosion particles, switch to EXPLODING state, and maybe start a timer for the delay before restarting.

Explosion particles: each frame, update their position based on velocity * deltaTime. Decrease lifespan. If lifespan <=0, remove the particle. Also, maybe adjust their size or alpha based on remaining lifespan.

Rendering: clear the canvas each frame. Depending on the state, draw vehicles or particles.

Now, let's think about the classes.

**Vehicle Class:**

constructor:
- x: random between 0 and canvas width - width
- y: random between 0 and canvas height - height
- vx: random between -5 and 5
- vy: random between -5 and 5
- width and height: maybe 20x40? Or 30x60?
- isActive: true
- color: random RGB

methods:
- update(deltaTime): x += vx * deltaTime; y += vy * deltaTime; wrap if needed
- wrap(): if x < 0, x = canvas.width; if x > canvas.width, x = 0; similarly for y.
- draw(context): fillRect for body. Maybe add wheels as circles. But for simplicity, maybe just a rectangle.

**ExplosionParticle Class:**

constructor:
- x, y: collision point
- vx: random between -10 and 10
- vy: random between -10 and 10
- lifespan: random between 100 and 300 (frames, assuming 60fps, so 1.6 to 5 seconds)
- size: random between 2 and 5
- color: white or random color

methods:
- update(deltaTime): x += vx * deltaTime; y += vy * deltaTime; lifespan -= deltaTime; if lifespan <=0, mark as dead
- draw(context): fill circle with alpha based on remaining lifespan (alpha = lifespan / initialLifespan)

**State Management:**

global variables:
- simulationState: 'RUNNING', 'EXPLODING', 'RESTARTING'
- vehicles: array of Vehicle objects
- explosionParticles: array of ExplosionParticle objects
- canvas: getElementById('simulationCanvas')
- ctx: canvas.getContext('2d')
- stateTimers: e.g., a timer for the RESTARTING state

**Animation Loop:**

function animate(timestamp) {
    let deltaTime = (timestamp - lastTimestamp) / 1000; // seconds
    lastTimestamp = timestamp;

    switch (simulationState) {
        case 'RUNNING':
            updateVehicles(deltaTime);
            checkCollisions();
            break;
        case 'EXPLODING':
            updateParticles(deltaTime);
            if (allParticlesDead()) {
                simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
                setTimeout(() => {
                    resetSimulation();
                    simulationState = 'RUNNING';
                }, 3000); // wait 3 seconds before restarting
            }
            break;
        case 'RESTARTING':
            // No updates, wait for timer to reset
            break;
    }

    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    switch (simulationState) {
        case 'RUNNING':
            drawVehicles();
            break;
        case 'EXPLODING':
            drawParticles();
            // Also draw "BOOM" text
            drawBoom();
            break;
        case 'RESTARTING':
            // Maybe draw something indicating restarting?
            break;
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

**Collision Detection:**

function checkCollisions() {
    for (let i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++) {
        if (!vehicles[i].isActive) continue;
        for (let j = i+1; j < vehicles.length; j++) {
            if (!vehicles[j].isActive) continue;
            if (checkCollision(vehicles[i], vehicles[j])) {
                handleCollision(i, j);
                return; // Once collision is handled, break out of loops
            }
        }
    }
}

function checkCollision(v1, v2) {
    // AABB check
    return v1.x < v2.x + v2.width &&
           v1.x + v1.width > v2.x &&
           v1.y < v2.y + v2.height &&
           v1.y + v1.height > v2.y;
}

**Handling Collision:**

function handleCollision(i, j) {
    vehicles[i].isActive = false;
    vehicles[j].isActive = false;
    const collisionX = (vehicles[i].x + vehicles[j].x + vehicles[i].width/2 + vehicles[j].width/2) / 2;
    const collisionY = (vehicles[i].y + vehicles[j].y + vehicles[i].height/2 + vehicles[j].height/2) / 2;
    createExplosionParticles(collisionX, collisionY);
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
}

**Creating Explosion Particles:**

function createExplosionParticles(x, y) {
    explosionParticles = []; // Clear existing particles
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
        const speed = Math.random() * 50 + 50; // speed between 50-100
        const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
        const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;
        const lifespan = Math.random() * 2000 + 1000; // 1-3 seconds
        explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan));
    }
}

**ExplosionParticle Class:**

constructor(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = vx;
    this.vy = vy;
    this.lifespan = lifespan;
    this.size = Math.random() * 5 + 2; // size between 2-7
    this.color = 'white'; // or random color
}

update(deltaTime) {
    this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
    this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;
    this.lifespan -= deltaTime;
}

draw(context) {
    const alpha = this.lifespan / this.initialLifespan;
    context.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${alpha})`;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
}

**Drawing "BOOM" Text:**

During the EXPLODING state, we need to draw "BOOM" expanding at the collision point. This can be a text that grows over time and then fades.

We can have a BOOM object with position, scale, and alpha. It starts small, scales up, then scales down and fades.

But this adds complexity. Alternatively, we can create a BOOM animation using canvas methods, perhaps a circle that expands and then contracts, with "BOOM" written inside.

Alternatively, use a single frame of "BOOM" text that scales up and then fades. Let's think: when a collision occurs, create a BOOM object that expands for a second, then fades out.

But integrating this into the explosion state. Maybe the BOOM is part of the explosion particles or a separate object.

Alternatively, during the EXPLODING state, after creating the particles, we can create a BOOM object that animates independently.

But for simplicity, perhaps the BOOM is just a static text at the collision point that appears for a few frames. But the requirement says "show the BOOM text, maybe expanding at the viewer".

So maybe the BOOM text scales up from small to large, then fades out.

We can manage this with a BOOM object that has a scale and alpha, which increases and then decreases over time.

But this requires additional state management. Let's see.

Alternatively, during the EXPLODING state, after particles are created, we can have a BOOM object that animates for a few seconds.

But integrating that into the existing code. Hmm.

Alternatively, when a collision happens, in addition to creating particles, we set a BOOM flag and track its state. Each frame during EXPLODING state, we update the BOOM's scale and alpha.

But this adds more state. Alternatively, the BOOM is a separate array that's managed during the EXPLODING state.

But perhaps for simplicity, the BOOM text is just a static text at the collision point, scaled up and then fades. So during the EXPLODING state, after particles are created, we have a BOOM object that starts expanding, then fades.

But integrating this into the existing structure.

Alternatively, the BOOM is part of the explosion particles, but that's not ideal. Maybe better to create a BOOM object that has its own animation.

This is getting complicated. Let's think: when a collision occurs, the BOOM text appears at the collision point, starts small, scales up to a larger size, then fades out. This animation should last for about 2 seconds.

So, in addition to the particles, we can have a BOOM object that has:

- x, y (position)
- scale (starts at 0.5, goes up to 1.5 over 1 second, then back down to 0.5 over 0.5 seconds)
- alpha (starts at 1, goes to 0 over 1.5 seconds)
- timeAlive (tracks how long it's been alive)

Each frame during EXPLODING state, we update the BOOM's scale and alpha based on timeAlive, and draw it.

This requires adding a BOOM object to the state. Let's see:

When a collision is detected:

- Create particles
- Create BOOM object with x, y, scale=0.5, alpha=1, timeAlive=0

Then, during EXPLODING state, update BOOM's timeAlive, scale, alpha.

But this adds more variables. Alternatively, the BOOM is part of the explosionParticles array, but that's not suitable. Alternatively, handle the BOOM separately.

This is getting a bit involved, but let's proceed.

In the handleCollision function, after creating particles, we create a BOOM object:

boom = {
    x: collisionX,
    y: collisionY,
    scale: 0.5,
    alpha: 1,
    timeAlive: 0,
    duration: 2 // seconds
}

Then, during the EXPLODING state, each frame, we update boom.timeAlive += deltaTime. If timeAlive exceeds duration, then set alpha to 0.

Then, when drawing, we draw the BOOM text with the current scale and alpha.

But integrating this into the existing code. So during EXPLODING state:

Update particles and BOOM.

But this requires adding the BOOM object to the state.

Alternatively, manage the BOOM as part of the EXPLODING state, but this complicates things.

Alternatively, the BOOM is part of the explosionParticles array. Each particle is a BOOM particle, but that's not right. Alternatively, the BOOM is a separate array.

But to keep things manageable, perhaps the BOOM is a separate object that's created when a collision occurs and updated during the EXPLODING state.

Let's proceed with that.

In the handleCollision function:

boom = {
    x: collisionX,
    y: collisionY,
    scale: 0.5,
    alpha: 1,
    timeAlive: 0,
    duration: 2, // total duration of the BOOM animation
}

Then, during the EXPLODING state:

update boom.timeAlive += deltaTime;

if timeAlive <= 1 second: scale increases from 0.5 to 1.5
if timeAlive > 1 second: scale decreases from 1.5 to 0.5
alpha decreases from 1 to 0 over the duration.

When drawing:

ctx.save();
ctx.globalAlpha = boom.alpha;
ctx.translate(boom.x, boom.y);
ctx.scale(boom.scale, boom.scale);
ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.textAlign = 'center';
ctx.fillText('BOOM', 0, 0);
ctx.restore();

But this requires setting up font size. So we need to set font size before drawing. Let's say font size is 20 * boom.scale.

But this adds more code. Alternatively, use a fixed font size and scale it with the BOOM's scale.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the BOOM is just a white circle that expands and fades, with 'BOOM' written inside.

Alternatively, for simplicity, the BOOM is just a static text at the collision point, scaled up once, then faded. So when a collision occurs, the BOOM text is drawn at the collision point with a fixed size and alpha, and it fades out over time.

But this may not be as dynamic as the requirement suggests. The requirement says "BOOM" text expanding at the viewer. So perhaps it starts small and grows over time.

Let's proceed with that. So during the EXPLODING state, in addition to particles, we have a BOOM object that starts at a small scale and grows to a larger scale over 1 second, then fades out over 1 second.

But integrating this into the code.

So in handleCollision:

boom = {
    x: collisionX,
    y: collisionY,
    scale: 0.5,
    alpha: 1,
    timeAlive: 0,
    maxScale: 2,
    duration: 2, // total time
}

Then, during EXPLODING state, update boom:

boom.timeAlive += deltaTime;

if boom.timeAlive < 1, scale = 0.5 + (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * (boom.timeAlive / 1)
else if boom.timeAlive < boom.duration, scale = boom.maxScale - (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * ((boom.timeAlive - 1) / 1)
alpha = 1 - (boom.timeAlive / boom.duration)

But this requires calculating the scale and alpha each frame. Then, when drawing:

ctx.save();
ctx.globalAlpha = boom.alpha;
ctx.translate(boom.x, boom.y);
ctx.scale(boom.scale, boom.scale);
ctx.font = '20px Arial'; // fixed font size, scaled by boom.scale
ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.textAlign = 'center';
ctx.fillText('BOOM', 0, 0);
ctx.restore();

This would make the 'BOOM' text start small, grow to maxScale, then shrink back, while fading out.

But this adds a bit of complexity, but it's manageable.

Now, putting all this together.

The code will have:

- Vehicle class
- ExplosionParticle class
- BOOM object
- State management
- Animation loop with state handling
- Collision detection
- Particles and BOOM rendering

Now, let's think about the Vehicle class.

Vehicle constructor:

function Vehicle(x, y, vx, vy, width, height, color) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = vx;
    this.vy = vy;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.color = color;
    this.isActive = true;
}

methods:

update(deltaTime) {
    this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
    this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;
    this.wrap();
}

wrap() {
    if (this.x < 0) this.x = canvas.width;
    if (this.x > canvas.width) this.x = 0;
    if (this.y < 0) this.y = canvas.height;
    if (this.y > canvas.height) this.y = 0;
}

draw(context) {
    context.fillStyle = this.color;
    context.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
    // optionally draw wheels as circles
}

ExplosionParticle constructor:

function ExplosionParticle(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = vx;
    this.vy = vy;
    this.lifespan = lifespan;
    this.initialLifespan = lifespan;
    this.size = Math.random() * 5 + 2; // size 2-7
    this.color = 'white';
}

update(deltaTime) {
    this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
    this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;
    this.lifespan -= deltaTime;
}

draw(context) {
    const alpha = this.lifespan / this.initialLifespan;
    context.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${alpha})`;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
}

Now, initializing vehicles:

function initializeVehicles() {
    vehicles = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        const x = Math.random() * (canvas.width - 30);
        const y = Math.random() * (canvas.height - 30);
        const vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
        const vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
        const color = `rgb(${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255})`;
        vehicles.push(new Vehicle(x, y, vx, vy, 30, 30, color));
    }
}

Now, the collision detection and handling:

function checkCollisions() {
    for (let i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++) {
        if (!vehicles[i].isActive) continue;
        for (let j = i+1; j < vehicles.length; j++) {
            if (!vehicles[j].isActive) continue;
            if (checkCollision(vehicles[i], vehicles[j])) {
                handleCollision(i, j);
                return; // only handle one collision per frame to avoid multiple
            }
        }
    }
}

function checkCollision(v1, v2) {
    return v1.x < v2.x + v2.width &&
           v1.x + v1.width > v2.x &&
           v1.y < v2.y + v2.height &&
           v1.y + v1.height > v2.y;
}

function handleCollision(i, j) {
    vehicles[i].isActive = false;
    vehicles[j].isActive = false;
    const collisionX = (vehicles[i].x + vehicles[j].x + vehicles[i].width/2 + vehicles[j].width/2) / 2;
    const collisionY = (vehicles[i].y + vehicles[j].y + vehicles[i].height/2 + vehicles[j].height/2) / 2;
    createExplosionParticles(collisionX, collisionY);
    createBoom(collisionX, collisionY);
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
}

function createExplosionParticles(x, y) {
    explosionParticles = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
        const speed = Math.random() * 50 + 50; // 50-100
        const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
        const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;
        const lifespan = Math.random() * 2000 + 1000; // 1-3 seconds
        explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan));
    }
}

function createBoom(x, y) {
    boom = {
        x: x,
        y: y,
        scale: 0.5,
        alpha: 1,
        timeAlive: 0,
        maxScale: 2,
        duration: 2 // seconds
    };
}

Now, during the EXPLODING state, we need to update the boom and particles.

But wait, the boom is a separate object. So during the EXPLODING state, we need to update the boom's timeAlive, scale, and alpha.

So in the animation loop's EXPLODING case:

updateParticles(deltaTime);
updateBoom(deltaTime);
if (allParticlesDead()) {
    simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    setTimeout(() => {
        resetSimulation();
        simulationState = 'RUNNING';
    }, 3000); // 3 seconds delay
}

But when do we check if all particles are dead? We need to check in the EXPLODING state. But if the boom's timeAlive exceeds its duration, it's done.

But perhaps the EXPLODING state continues until all particles are dead and the boom is done.

Alternatively, during the EXPLODING state, we update particles and boom. Once both particles are all dead and boom's timeAlive exceeds its duration, switch to RESTARTING.

But this complicates the logic. Alternatively, when the EXPLODING state starts, we track if the explosion is done (particles all dead and boom faded). Once that's true, switch to RESTARTING.

But this requires checking in each frame.

Alternatively, during the EXPLODING state, after updating particles and boom, check if all particles are dead and the boom's timeAlive exceeds its duration. If so, switch to RESTARTING.

But the boom's duration is 2 seconds. So particles might take 3 seconds to die, but the boom fades after 2 seconds. So the EXPLODING state would transition to RESTARTING when all particles are dead, regardless of the boom.

But the requirement says after the explosion animation completes (which includes particles and BOOM), then restart. So the EXPLODING state should end when both particles are done and the BOOM has faded.

But this complicates the code. Alternatively, the EXPLODING state ends when all particles are dead, and then the RESTARTING state adds a 3-second delay before restarting.

But the BOOM might have already faded out before the particles are done. So the BOOM is part of the EXPLODING state, but once the particles are done, the simulation goes to RESTARTING, which adds a delay before restarting.

This way, the BOOM is part of the EXPLODING state, and the RESTARTING state adds the delay.

So, in code:

When in EXPLODING state:

- Update particles and boom.
- If all particles are dead, switch to RESTARTING.
- In RESTARTING state, wait for 3 seconds, then reset and go back to RUNNING.

So the code would be:

In animation loop:

case 'EXPLODING':
    updateParticles(deltaTime);
    updateBoom(deltaTime);
    if (allParticlesDead()) {
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
        setTimeout(() => {
            resetSimulation();
            simulationState = 'RUNNING';
        }, 3000);
    }
    break;

But the BOOM is part of the EXPLODING state. So when the EXPLODING state transitions to RESTARTING, the BOOM is no longer updated. But the BOOM's animation should have already completed before the particles are done.

Alternatively, the BOOM's duration is shorter than the particles' lifespan. So when the particles are still alive, the BOOM has already faded. So when all particles are dead, the simulation moves to RESTARTING, which adds a 3-second delay before restarting.

But this may not align with the requirement that the BOOM text is part of the explosion animation. The BOOM should be shown during the explosion, even if particles are still active.

But perhaps the BOOM is part of the EXPLODING state, and once the BOOM's animation is done, it's no longer drawn, but the particles continue until they are all dead. Then, after that, the simulation goes to RESTARTING.

But this complicates the state transitions.

Alternatively, the BOOM is part of the particles array. Each BOOM particle has a specific behavior. But this seems messy.

Alternatively, the BOOM is a separate object that's updated during the EXPLODING state, but when the BOOM's timeAlive exceeds its duration, it's set to null. But this requires checking both particles and BOOM.

But this is getting too complicated. For the sake of time, perhaps the BOOM is part of the explosion particles, but that's not correct. Alternatively, proceed with the BOOM being handled in the EXPLODING state, and the RESTARTING state adds a delay.

In any case, the BOOM's animation should be part of the EXPLODING state, and when the particles are all dead, the simulation moves to RESTARTING, which adds a delay before restarting.

Now, the code for updating the boom:

function updateBoom(deltaTime) {
    if (!boom) return;
    boom.timeAlive += deltaTime;
    if (boom.timeAlive < 1) {
        boom.scale = 0.5 + (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * (boom.timeAlive / 1);
    } else if (boom.timeAlive < boom.duration) {
        boom.scale = boom.maxScale - (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * ((boom.timeAlive - 1) / 1);
    } else {
        boom.alpha = 0;
    }
    boom.alpha = 1 - (boom.timeAlive / boom.duration);
}

But this might not be correct. The alpha should decrease over the entire duration. Let's adjust:

boom.alpha = 1 - Math.min(1, boom.timeAlive / boom.duration);

And scale:

if (boom.timeAlive < 1) {
    boom.scale = 0.5 + (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * (boom.timeAlive / 1);
} else if (boom.timeAlive < boom.duration) {
    boom.scale = boom.maxScale - (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * ((boom.timeAlive - 1) / (boom.duration - 1));
} else {
    boom.scale = 0.5; // or some minimum
}

But this requires more precise math.

Alternatively, the scale increases linearly from 0.5 to 2 over 1 second, then decreases back to 0.5 over 1 second.

So total duration is 2 seconds. TimeAlive from 0 to 2.

For 0 <= t < 1: scale = 0.5 + 1.5 * t
For 1 <= t < 2: scale = 2 - 1.5 * (t - 1)
alpha = 1 - t / 2

But this way, alpha decreases from 1 to 0 over 2 seconds.

So:

if (boom.timeAlive < 1) {
    boom.scale = 0.5 + (2 - 0.5) * (boom.timeAlive / 1);
} else if (boom.timeAlive < 2) {
    boom.scale = 2 - (2 - 0.5) * ((boom.timeAlive - 1) / 1);
} else {
    boom.scale = 0.5; // or 0, but probably not needed since after 2 seconds, alpha is 0
}
boom.alpha = 1 - (boom.timeAlive / 2);

But this way, the scale goes from 0.5 to 2 in 1 second, then back to 0.5 in the next 1 second, while alpha decreases from 1 to 0 over 2 seconds.

But when timeAlive exceeds 2, the BOOM is done. But in practice, once alpha is 0, we can stop updating it.

Now, rendering the BOOM:

function drawBoom() {
    if (!boom) return;
    ctx.save();
    ctx.globalAlpha = boom.alpha;
    ctx.translate(boom.x, boom.y);
    ctx.scale(boom.scale, boom.scale);
    ctx.font = '20px Arial';
    ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
    ctx.textAlign = 'center';
    ctx.fillText('BOOM', 0, 0);
    ctx.restore();
}

Now, putting all this into the code.

The main code structure will be:

- Set up canvas and context.
- Initialize vehicles.
- Set up state variables.
- Implement animation loop.
- Define Vehicle, ExplosionParticle classes.
- Implement collision detection and handling.
- Update particles and boom during EXPLODING state.
- Draw vehicles, particles, and boom as needed.

Now, let's code this step by step.

First, the HTML structure is given, with a canvas of 512x512.

In the JavaScript section:

Get the canvas and context:

const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

Initialize variables:

let vehicles = [];
let explosionParticles = [];
let boom = null;
let simulationState = 'RUNNING';
let lastTimestamp = 0;

Vehicle class:

class Vehicle {
    constructor(x, y, vx, vy, width, height, color) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = vx;
        this.vy = vy;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
        this.color = color;
        this.isActive = true;
    }
    update(deltaTime) {
        this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
        this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;
        this.wrap();
    }
    wrap() {
        if (this.x < 0) this.x = canvas.width;
        if (this.x > canvas.width) this.x = 0;
        if (this.y < 0) this.y = canvas.height;
        if (this.y > canvas.height) this.y = 0;
    }
    draw(context) {
        context.fillStyle = this.color;
        context.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
    }
}

ExplosionParticle class:

class ExplosionParticle {
    constructor(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = vx;
        this.vy = vy;
        this.lifespan = lifespan;
        this.initialLifespan = lifespan;
        this.size = Math.random() * 5 + 2;
        this.color = 'white';
    }
    update(deltaTime) {
        this.x += this.vx * deltaTime;
        this.y += this.vy * deltaTime;
        this.lifespan -= deltaTime;
    }
    draw(context) {
        const alpha = this.lifespan / this.initialLifespan;
        context.fillStyle = `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${alpha})`;
        context.beginPath();
        context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        context.fill();
    }
}

Initialize vehicles:

function initializeVehicles() {
    vehicles = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        const x = Math.random() * (canvas.width - 30);
        const y = Math.random() * (canvas.height - 30);
        const vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
        const vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
        const color = `rgb(${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255})`;
        vehicles.push(new Vehicle(x, y, vx, vy, 30, 30, color));
    }
}

Collision detection:

function checkCollisions() {
    for (let i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++) {
        if (!vehicles[i].isActive) continue;
        for (let j = i+1; j < vehicles.length; j++) {
            if (!vehicles[j].isActive) continue;
            if (checkCollision(vehicles[i], vehicles[j])) {
                handleCollision(i, j);
                return; // handle one collision per frame
            }
        }
    }
}

function checkCollision(v1, v2) {
    return v1.x < v2.x + v2.width &&
           v1.x + v1.width > v2.x &&
           v1.y < v2.y + v2.height &&
           v1.y + v1.height > v2.y;
}

Handle collision:

function handleCollision(i, j) {
    vehicles[i].isActive = false;
    vehicles[j].isActive = false;
    const collisionX = (vehicles[i].x + vehicles[j].x + vehicles[i].width/2 + vehicles[j].width/2) / 2;
    const collisionY = (vehicles[i].y + vehicles[j].y + vehicles[i].height/2 + vehicles[j].height/2) / 2;
    createExplosionParticles(collisionX, collisionY);
    createBoom(collisionX, collisionY);
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
}

createExplosionParticles:

function createExplosionParticles(x, y) {
    explosionParticles = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
        const speed = Math.random() * 50 + 50;
        const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
        const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;
        const lifespan = Math.random() * 2000 + 1000;
        explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan));
    }
}

createBoom:

function createBoom(x, y) {
    boom = {
        x: x,
        y: y,
        scale: 0.5,
        alpha: 1,
        timeAlive: 0,
        maxScale: 2,
        duration: 2 // seconds
    };
}

Update particles and boom:

function updateParticles(deltaTime) {
    for (let i = explosionParticles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        explosionParticles[i].update(deltaTime);
        if (explosionParticles[i].lifespan <= 0) {
            explosionParticles.splice(i, 1);
        }
    }
}

function updateBoom(deltaTime) {
    if (!boom) return;
    boom.timeAlive += deltaTime;
    if (boom.timeAlive < 1) {
        boom.scale = 0.5 + (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * (boom.timeAlive / 1);
    } else if (boom.timeAlive < boom.duration) {
        boom.scale = boom.maxScale - (boom.maxScale - 0.5) * ((boom.timeAlive - 1) / 1);
    } else {
        boom.alpha = 0;
    }
    boom.alpha = 1 - Math.min(1, boom.timeAlive / boom.duration);
}

Check if all particles are dead:

function allParticlesDead() {
    return explosionParticles.length === 0;
}

Reset simulation:

function resetSimulation() {
    vehicles = []; // re-initialize vehicles
    initializeVehicles();
    explosionParticles = [];
    boom = null;
}

Draw functions:

function drawVehicles() {
    for (const vehicle of vehicles) {
        if (vehicle.isActive) {
            vehicle.draw(ctx);
        }
    }
}

function drawParticles() {
    for (const particle of explosionParticles) {
        particle.draw(ctx);
    }
}

function drawBoom() {
    if (!boom) return;
    ctx.save();
    ctx.globalAlpha = boom.alpha;
    ctx.translate(boom.x, boom.y);
    ctx.scale(boom.scale, boom.scale);
    ctx.font = '20px Arial';
    ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
    ctx.textAlign = 'center';
    ctx.fillText('BOOM', 0, 0);
    ctx.restore();
}

Animation loop:

function animate(timestamp) {
    const deltaTime = (timestamp - lastTimestamp) / 1000;
    lastTimestamp = timestamp;

    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    switch (simulationState) {
        case 'RUNNING':
            updateVehicles(deltaTime);
            checkCollisions();
            drawVehicles();
            break;
        case 'EXPLODING':
            updateParticles(deltaTime);
            updateBoom(deltaTime);
            drawParticles();
            drawBoom();
            if (allParticlesDead()) {
                simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
                setTimeout(() => {
                    resetSimulation();
                    simulationState = 'RUNNING';
                }, 3000); // 3 seconds delay before restarting
            }
            break;
        case 'RESTARTING':
            // Do nothing, wait for timer to reset
            break;
    }

    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}

Update vehicles:

function updateVehicles(deltaTime) {
    for (const vehicle of vehicles) {
        if (vehicle.isActive) {
            vehicle.update(deltaTime);
        }
    }
}

Initialize:

initializeVehicles();
lastTimestamp = performance.now();
requestAnimationFrame(animate);

This code should meet all the requirements:

- Vehicle objects are managed in an array.
- Initialization creates vehicles with random positions and velocities.
- Vehicles move and wrap around the canvas edges.
- Collision detection between vehicles using AABB checks.
- Upon collision, vehicles are marked inactive, explosion particles are created, and BOOM text is displayed.
- Explosion particles have random velocities, lifespans, and fade out.
- The simulation transitions to EXPLODING state during collision, then to RESTARTING after particles die, then restarts after a delay.
