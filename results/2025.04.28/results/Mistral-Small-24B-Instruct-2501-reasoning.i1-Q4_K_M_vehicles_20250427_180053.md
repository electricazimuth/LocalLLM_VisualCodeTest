Okay, so I need to create this vehicle collision simulation. Let me start by breaking down the requirements and figuring out how to approach each part.

First, the setup. The simulation will run on an HTML5 canvas. I need to manage multiple vehicles, their movement, screen wrapping, collision detection, explosion effects, and restarting the simulation. All using just JavaScript and the Canvas API.

Let me outline the key components:

1. **Vehicle Class:** Each vehicle has position, velocity, size, and a method to draw itself. Maybe also a method to update its position considering wrapping.
2. **Explosion Particles:** When a collision happens, create a bunch of particles that spread out from the collision point, fade away, and eventually get cleared.
3. **Simulation State:** The simulation can be in different states: running, exploding, restarting. Each state affects what gets updated and drawn.
4. **Collision Detection:** Check for overlaps between vehicles. Since vehicles are rectangles (or maybe circles?), I need to detect when their boundaries intersect.
5. **Main Loop:** Use requestAnimationFrame to create a smooth animation loop, handling delta time for consistent movement regardless of frame rate.

Let me start by setting up the canvas and basic variables.

In the HTML, the canvas is already provided with ID "simulationCanvas". Let me get the context in the JavaScript.

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('simulationCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

Next, set up some variables for the simulation state, vehicles, and explosion particles.

```javascript
let simulationState = 'RUNNING'; // Possible states: 'RUNNING', 'EXPLODING', 'RESTARTING'
let vehicles = [];
let explosionParticles = [];
let explosionStartTime = 0;
const explosionDuration = 5000; // 5 seconds before restarting
```

Now, the Vehicle class. Let's define it with position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), size (width, height), and methods for updating and drawing.

```javascript
class Vehicle {
    constructor(x, y, vx, vy, width=20, height=40) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = vx;
        this.vy = vy;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
        this.isActive = true;
    }

    update(dt) {
        this.x += this.vx * dt;
        this.y += this.vy * dt;

        // Wrap around the screen edges
        if (this.x + this.width > canvas.width) this.x = -this.width;
        if (this.x < -this.width) this.x = canvas.width - this.width;
        if (this.y + this.height > canvas.height) this.y = -this.height;
        if (this.y < -this.height) this.y = canvas.height - this.height;
    }

    draw() {
        if (!this.isActive) return;

        ctx.fillStyle = 'red'; // Maybe color them differently later
        ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
        // Drawing wheels as circles
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(this.x + this.width/4, this.y + this.height, 5, 0, 2*Math.PI);
        ctx.arc(this.x + 3*this.width/4, this.y + this.height, 5, 0, 2*Math.PI);
        ctx.fillStyle = 'black';
        ctx.fill();
    }
}
```

Next, the explosion particles. Each particle needs position, velocity, lifespan, size, and color.

```javascript
class ExplosionParticle {
    constructor(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan=1000) { // lifespan in ms
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = vx + (Math.random() - 0.5)*100; // Random spread
        this.vy = vy + (Math.random() - 0.5)*100;
        this.lifespan = lifespan;
        this.size = Math.random() * 5 + 5; // Random size between 5 and 10
        this.color = 'yellow'; // Or a random color
    }

    update(dt) {
        this.x += this.vx * dt;
        this.y += this.vy * vy * dt; // Wait, should that be vy * dt? Wait, no, velocity components are in pixels per second. So yes, multiply by dt (seconds) to get displacement.

        this.lifespan -= dt;
    }

    draw() {
        if (this.lifespan <= 0) return;

        let alpha = this.lifespan / 1000; // Fade out as lifespan decreases
        ctx.fillStyle = this.color + alpha;
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, 2*Math.PI);
        ctx.fill();
    }
}
```

Now, the main simulation loop. Let's use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation. The loop should handle different states: running, exploding, restarting.

First, the main loop function.

```javascript
function loop(timestamp) {
    const dt = (timestamp - previousTimestamp) / 1000; // delta time in seconds
    previousTimestamp = timestamp;

    if (simulationState === 'RUNNING') {
        updateRunning(dt);
    } else if (simulationState === 'EXPLODING') {
        updateExploding(dt);
    } else if (simulationState === 'RESTARTING') {
        updateRestarting(dt);
    }

    draw();

    requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}

let previousTimestamp = 0;
requestAnimationFrame(loop);
```

Now, the state-specific update functions.

**Running State:**
Update all active vehicles, check for collisions.

```javascript
function updateRunning(dt) {
    for (let vehicle of vehicles) {
        if (vehicle.isActive) vehicle.update(dt);
    }

    detectCollisions();
}
```

**Exploding State:**
Update all explosion particles, check if they're done.

```javascript
function updateExploding(dt) {
    for (let particle of explosionParticles) {
        particle.update(dt);
    }

    explosionParticles = explosionParticles.filter(p => p.lifespan > 0);

    if (explosionParticles.length === 0 && Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration) {
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}
```

**Restarting State:**
Reset variables and re-initialize vehicles.

```javascript
function updateRestarting(dt) {
    // Wait a bit before restarting, then reset everything
    if (Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration + 2000) { // 5 seconds + 2 seconds delay
        vehicles = initializeVehicles(5); // Let's say 5 vehicles
        explosionParticles = [];
        simulationState = 'RUNNING';
    }
}
```

Now, collision detection. Let's loop through all pairs of active vehicles and check for intersections.

```javascript
function detectCollisions() {
    for (let i = 0; i < vehicles.length - 1; i++) {
        if (!vehicles[i].isActive) continue;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < vehicles.length; j++) {
            if (!vehicles[j].isActive) continue;
            if (doVehiclesCollide(vehicles[i], vehicles[j])) {
                handleCollision(vehicles[i], vehicles[j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Check if two vehicles collide. Since they are rectangles, we can check if their boundaries overlap.

```javascript
function doVehiclesCollide(vehicleA, vehicleB) {
    return vehicleA.x < vehicleB.x + vehicleB.width &&
           vehicleA.x + vehicleA.width > vehicleB.x &&
           vehicleA.y < vehicleB.y + vehicleB.height &&
           vehicleA.y + vehicleA.height > vehicleB.y;
}
```

When a collision occurs, deactivate the vehicles and create explosion particles.

```javascript
function handleCollision(vehicleA, vehicleB) {
    vehicleA.isActive = false;
    vehicleB.isActive = false;

    const collisionPoint = {
        x: (vehicleA.x + vehicleB.x + vehicleA.width + vehicleB.width)/2,
        y: (vehicleA.y + vehicleB.y + vehicleA.height + vehicleB.height)/2,
    }

    createExplosion(collisionPoint.x, collisionPoint.y);
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
    explosionStartTime = Date.now();
}
```

Create explosion particles. Let's make 30 particles with random velocities.

```javascript
function createExplosion(x, y) {
    for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
        let vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 200; // Random velocity in x direction
        let vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 200; // Random velocity in y direction
        let lifespan = 1000 + Math.random() * 2000; // Lifespan between 1 and 3 seconds
        explosionParticles.push(new ExplosionParticle(x, y, vx, vy, lifespan));
    }
}
```

Drawing the simulation based on the state.

```javascript
function draw() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    if (simulationState === 'RUNNING') {
        drawVehicles();
    } else if (simulationState === 'EXPLODING') {
        drawExplosionParticles();
        drawBoomText();
    } else if (simulationState === 'RESTARTING') {
        drawRestartingText();
    }
}

function drawVehicles() {
    for (let vehicle of vehicles) {
        if (vehicle.isActive) vehicle.draw();
    }
}

function drawExplosionParticles() {
    for (let particle of explosionParticles) {
        particle.draw();
    }
}

function drawBoomText() {
    const boomText = "BOOM";
    const boomFontSize = 100;
    ctx.font = boomFontSize + "px Arial";
    let textWidth = ctx.measureText(boomText).width;
    let x = (canvas.width - textWidth)/2;
    let y = (canvas.height - boomFontSize)/2 + 50; // Position it lower
    ctx.fillStyle = 'yellow';
    ctx.fillText(boomText, x, y);

    // Expanding effect by increasing font size over time
    const timeElapsed = Date.now() - explosionStartTime;
    if (timeElapsed < explosionDuration) {
        let scale = 1 + (timeElapsed / explosionDuration) * 1.5;
        ctx.font = boomFontSize * scale + "px Arial";
    }
}

function drawRestartingText() {
    const restartingText = "Restarting...";
    const restartingFontSize = 50;
    let x = (canvas.width - ctx.measureText(restartingText).width)/2;
    let y = (canvas.height - restartingFontSize)/2;
    ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
    ctx.fillText(restartingText, x, y);
}
```

Finally, initialize the simulation with some vehicles.

```javascript
function initializeVehicles(numberOfVehicles = 5) {
    let vehicles = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < numberOfVehicles; i++) {
        let x = Math.random() * (canvas.width - 40); // 40 is the width of the vehicle
        let y = Math.random() * (canvas.height - 40); // 40 is the height of the vehicle
        let vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 200; // Velocity between -100 and 100 pixels per second
        let vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 200;
        vehicles.push(new Vehicle(x, y, vx, vy, 40, 40)); // width and height of 40
    }

    return vehicles;
}

window.onload = () => {
    vehicles = initializeVehicles(5); // Start with 5 vehicles
    previousTimestamp = performance.now();
    requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
```

Wait, the vehicle size was set to 40x40, but in the Vehicle class, the default width and height are 20 and 40. Hmm, inconsistency here. Let me fix that.

In the Vehicle class constructor, set width and height to 40. Wait, but in the collision detection, the vehicles are considered as rectangles. If they are 40x40, but in the drawing, we have a rectangle of 40x40 with two wheels (circles of radius 5). Wait, maybe the vehicle's height is 40, and width is 40. Let me adjust the Vehicle class.

Wait, actually, in the Vehicle class, the width and height can be parameters. In the collision detection, we use the width and height for the rectangle. In the drawing, we have a rectangle and two circles for wheels. So if the vehicle is 40x40, then the wheels are at the bottom, each 5 units radius. That makes sense.

But in the initializeVehicles function, when pushing new vehicles, I set width and height as 40. So the Vehicle class should have width and height as 40.

But in the collision detection, the check is using the vehicle's width and height. So that's consistent.

Wait, the collision detection uses the full rectangle of the vehicle, which includes the wheels. But since the wheels are part of the vehicle's structure, that's okay. So if two vehicles' rectangles overlap, they collide.

But perhaps, in reality, vehicles might collide even if their centers are within a certain distance. But since we are using axis-aligned rectangles, the collision detection is straightforward.

Alternatively, if the vehicles are circles (using the center and radius), collision detection would be different. But since the problem mentions "simple visual effects", maybe rectangles are acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the vehicle is represented as a rectangle with two circles for wheels, but the collision is based on the rectangle. That seems reasonable.

So, the collision detection is based on the rectangle overlapping. So, when two rectangles overlap, they collide, and the explosion occurs.

Now, let's test this setup.

But wait, in the Vehicle class, the constructor has width=20, height=40. But in the initializeVehicles function, we set width and height as 40. So that's a conflict.

Wait, no. The Vehicle class constructor has width=20 and height=40, but when we create a new vehicle, we can override those parameters. So in the initializeVehicles function, we can set width=40 and height=40. Let me confirm.

Yes, in the Vehicle class, the constructor has default width=20, height=40, but when we call the constructor in initializeVehicles, we pass width=40, height=40. So each vehicle will have width 40, height 40. So the collision detection will use those dimensions.

But in the drawing method, the vehicle is a rectangle of 40x40, and two wheels (circles of radius 5). Wait, but if the vehicle's height is 40, then the wheels would be at the bottom, which is at y + height. But if the vehicle's height is 40, then the bottom of the vehicle is at y + 40. The wheels are drawn at (x + width/4, y + height) and (x + 3*width/4, y + height). But if the vehicle's height is 40, then the wheels are drawn at the bottom of the vehicle. But the vehicle is a rectangle from (x, y) to (x + width, y + height). So the wheels are at the bottom, which is correct.

So, with the vehicles being 40x40 rectangles, moving around the canvas, wrapping when they go off the edge. Collision detection is based on overlapping rectangles. When a collision occurs, the two vehicles are deactivated, and an explosion is created at their center point. The simulation switches to the 'EXPLODING' state, where explosion particles are updated and drawn. After a delay, the simulation restarts with new vehicles.

But there's a problem here. The explosion particles are created at the collision point, but the collision point is the overlapping area. Wait, in the handleCollision function, I compute the collision point as the center between the two vehicles. Let me check that.

The collision point is calculated as the average of the positions and sizes of the two vehicles. So for x-coordinate: (vehicleA.x + vehicleB.x + vehicleA.width + vehicleB.width)/2. Similarly for y-coordinate. This gives the center of the overlapping area, which is a good point for the explosion.

But maybe a better approach is to take the midpoint between the centers of the two vehicles. The center of each vehicle is at (x + width/2, y + height/2). So the collision point could be the midpoint between these two centers.

Wait, let's compute that. For vehicle A: center at (A.x + A.width/2, A.y + A.height/2). For vehicle B: (B.x + B.width/2, B.y + B.height/2). The collision point would be the average of these two centers.

So:

x = (A.x + A.width/2 + B.x + B.width/2)/2 = (A.x + B.x) + (A.width + B.width)/4

But if both vehicles are 40x40, then:

x = (A.x + B.x) + (40 + 40)/4 = (A.x + B.x) + 20

Similarly, y = (A.y + B.y) + (40 + 40)/4 = (A.y + B.y) + 20

But wait, this is assuming that the collision point is the midpoint between the centers. However, in reality, the collision occurs over an area, but for simplicity, using the midpoint is reasonable.

But in my initial calculation, I had:

x = (A.x + B.x + A.width + B.width)/2, which is (A.x + B.x + 40 + 40)/2 = (A.x + B.x + 80)/2 = (A.x + B.x)/2 + 40

Similarly, y = (A.y + B.y + 80)/2 = (A.y + B.y)/2 + 40

But the center of each vehicle is (A.x + 20, A.y + 20), since the vehicle is 40x40. So the midpoint between centers would be:

((A.x + 20) + (B.x + 20))/2, ((A.y + 20) + (B.y + 20))/2)

Which is ((A.x + B.x)/2 + 20, (A.y + B.y)/2 + 20)

But in the initial calculation, we have ((A.x + B.x)/2 + 40, (A.y + B.y)/2 + 40). So there's a discrepancy of 20 pixels in both x and y. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the collision point. If two 40x40 vehicles collide, the overlapping area's center would be the average of their positions. Wait, let me take an example.

Suppose Vehicle A is at (0, 0) and Vehicle B is at (40, 40). Their overlap would be from (0,0) to (40,40) for A, and (40,40) to (80,80) for B. Wait, no, if both are 40x40, then if A is at (0,0) and B is at (20,20), they would overlap. The overlapping area would be from (20,20) to (40,40). The center of the overlapping area is (30,30). Which is (A.x + 10, A.y + 10) or (B.x + 10, B.y + 10). So the center is the average of the overlapping region.

But how to compute this? If two rectangles overlap, the center of the overlapping area is the midpoint of the overlapping region.

Alternatively, since the collision is detected between two rectangles, the explosion should occur at the center of the overlapping area. To compute that, we can take the average of the overlapping x and y ranges.

The overlapping x-range is from max(A.x, B.x) to min(A.x + A.width, B.x + B.width). Similarly for y.

So the center x is (max(A.x, B.x) + min(A.x + A.width, B.x + B.width)) / 2.

Similarly for center y.

But this might be more accurate. Let me compute that.

For two vehicles A and B:

overlap_x_start = max(A.x, B.x);
overlap_x_end = min(A.x + A.width, B.x + B.width);
overlap_y_start = max(A.y, B.y);
overlap_y_end = min(A.y + A.height, B.y + B.height);

if (overlap_x_start < overlap_x_end && overlap_y_start < overlap_y_end) {
    collision_center_x = (overlap_x_start + overlap_x_end) / 2;
    collision_center_y = (overlap_y_start + overlap_y_end) / 2;
} else {
    collision_center_x = (A.x + B.x + A.width + B.width) / 2;
    collision_center_y = (A.y + B.y + A.height + B.height) / 2;
}

Wait, but if they don't overlap, then the center would be outside. Wait, no. If they don't overlap, the collision didn't happen. So in the case of collision, the overlap_x_start < overlap_x_end and overlap_y_start < overlap_y_end.

Therefore, in the collision case, the center of the overlapping area is ((overlap_x_start + overlap_x_end)/2, (overlap_y_start + overlap_y_end)/2). Which is the midpoint of the overlapping rectangle.

But this requires calculating the overlap range. Alternatively, since both vehicles are axis-aligned, the overlapping area's center can be calculated as:

((A.x + A.width)/2 + (B.x + B.width)/2)/2, ((A.y + A.height)/2 + (B.y + B.height)/2)/2)

Wait, no. The center of each vehicle is (A.x + A.width/2, A.y + A.height/2). Similarly for B. The midpoint between the centers is ((A.x + A.width/2 + B.x + B.width/2)/2, (A.y + A.height/2 + B.y + B.height/2)/2). Which simplifies to ((A.x + B.x)/2 + (A.width + B.width)/4, (A.y + B.y)/2 + (A.height + B.height)/4).

If both vehicles are 40x40, then:

collision_center_x = (A.x + B.x)/2 + (40 + 40)/4 = (A.x + B.x)/2 + 20
collision_center_y = (A.y + B.y)/2 + (40 + 40)/4 = (A.y + B.y)/2 + 20

But if the two vehicles are overlapping, their centers are separated by less than the sum of their half-diagonals. But since they are rectangles, maybe the midpoint between their centers is different from the overlapping area's center.

However, for simplicity, in the initial code, I took the collision point as ((A.x + B.x + A.width + B.width)/2, (A.y + B.y + A.height + B.height)/2). Let's see what that gives.

If A is at (0, 0) and B is at (30, 30), both 40x40. Then the collision point would be ((0 + 30 + 40 + 40)/2, (0 + 30 + 40 + 40)/2) = (110/2, 110/2) = (55, 55). But the overlapping area is from (30, 30) to (40, 40), so the center is (35, 35). So there's a discrepancy here. The code's collision point is (55,55), which is outside the overlapping area. That seems incorrect.

Therefore, my initial approach to calculate the collision point is flawed. Instead, the correct collision point should be the center of the overlapping area. So I need to compute that.

So let's adjust the handleCollision function to compute the overlapping area's center.

```javascript
function handleCollision(vehicleA, vehicleB) {
    vehicleA.isActive = false;
    vehicleB.isActive = false;

    const overlap_x_start = Math.max(vehicleA.x, vehicleB.x);
    const overlap_x_end = Math.min(vehicleA.x + vehicleA.width, vehicleB.x + vehicleB.width);
    const overlap_y_start = Math.max(vehicleA.y, vehicleB.y);
    const overlap_y_end = Math.min(vehicleA.y + vehicleA.height, vehicleB.y + vehicleB.height);

    const collisionPoint = {
        x: (overlap_x_start + overlap_x_end) / 2,
        y: (overlap_y_start + overlap_y_end) / 2
    };

    createExplosion(collisionPoint.x, collisionPoint.y);
    simulationState = 'EXPLODING';
    explosionStartTime = Date.now();
}
```

This ensures that the explosion is centered at the overlapping region, which makes more sense.

Now, let's test this. Suppose two vehicles are overlapping. The collision point is the center of their overlap. Then the explosion happens there.

Another thing to note: when a collision occurs, both vehicles are deactivated, and an explosion is created. Then, the simulation switches to 'EXPLODING' state, where only the explosion particles are updated and drawn. After a few seconds, the simulation restarts.

But what if multiple collisions occur before the first explosion is handled? In the current setup, the collision detection is only called when the simulation is in the 'RUNNING' state. Once a collision happens, the state switches to 'EXPLODING', so subsequent collisions are ignored until the next restart.

This is acceptable because once the state is 'EXPLODING', no further collisions are detected until the simulation restarts with new vehicles.

Another point: the explosion particles are created with a lifespan of between 1 and 3 seconds (1000 to 3000 ms). But in the updateExploding function, we subtract dt from each particle's lifespan. However, the explosionDuration is set to 5000 ms (5 seconds). So even if some particles have a lifespan longer than 5 seconds, they would be forcefully removed when the explosion duration ends. Wait, no. The explosionParticles are filtered to remove those with lifespan <= 0. However, the simulationState remains 'EXPLODING' until all particles are gone. But if some particles have a lifespan longer than the explosionDuration, then after explosionDuration, the simulation would switch to 'RESTARTING' even if there are still particles left. Wait, no. Let's check.

In the updateExploding function:

explosionParticles = explosionParticles.filter(p => p.lifespan > 0);

Then, check if (explosionParticles.length === 0 && Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration)

So even if there are particles left, as long as their lifespan is still positive, the simulation remains in 'EXPLODING'. Once all particles are gone (length === 0), and enough time has passed (explosionDuration), then switch to 'RESTARTING'. Wait, no. The code is:

if (explosionParticles.length === 0 && Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration) {
    simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
}

Wait, so after the explosion starts, if at any point the particles are all gone AND explosionDuration time has passed, then switch to 'RESTARTING'. But actually, if particles are gone before the explosionDuration, then we have to wait until explosionDuration to restart. Alternatively, if particles are gone after explosionDuration, then switch immediately.

Wait, no. The code is: after updating and filtering particles, if there are no particles left AND the time since explosionStartTime is >= explosionDuration, then switch to 'RESTARTING'.

But if particles are gone before explosionDuration, then we have to wait until explosionDuration to switch. For example, if all particles die at 3 seconds, but explosionDuration is 5 seconds, the simulation would stay in 'EXPLODING' until 5 seconds have passed, even though there are no particles. That's not desired. The simulation should switch to 'RESTARTING' when there are no more particles, regardless of the time.

Wait, the current logic is:

after updating particles, filter out dead ones. Then, check if the length is 0 AND the time since explosionStartTime is >= explosionDuration. So if particles are gone (length 0) and enough time has passed, switch to 'RESTARTING'. If particles are gone but not enough time has passed, remain in 'EXPLODING'.

But if particles are gone before explosionDuration, then the simulation would remain in 'EXPLODING' until explosionDuration is reached. That might not be the intended behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the explosionDuration is the total time from explosion start to restarting, regardless of particles. But in the current code, the explosionParticles are allowed to live out their lifespan, but the simulation doesn't switch to 'RESTARTING' until both the particles are gone AND the explosionDuration has passed. That might result in a longer wait than necessary.

Wait, perhaps the explosionDuration is the minimum between the time it takes for particles to expire and a fixed duration. Let me adjust the logic.

Instead of waiting until both particles are gone AND explosionDuration has passed, switch to 'RESTARTING' when either particles are gone or explosionDuration has passed, whichever comes first.

But the problem is, if particles are still present after explosionDuration, but the code is supposed to wait until they are gone. However, in the current setup, after explosionDuration, regardless of particles, the simulation restarts. Wait, no. The code says:

if (explosionParticles.length === 0 && Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration) {
    simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
}

But if particles are not gone, even if explosionDuration has passed, it doesn't switch. Conversely, if particles are gone before explosionDuration, it still doesn't switch. So the simulation remains in 'EXPLODING' until both conditions are met. That's not correct. It should switch to 'RESTARTING' when the explosion animation is done, which is when all particles have expired. However, to prevent the simulation from hanging indefinitely if particles never expire, a timeout is provided (explosionDuration). So if after explosionDuration, if there are still particles, force a restart.

But in the code, the condition is (explosionParticles.length === 0 && Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration). So the simulation will switch to 'RESTARTING' only when all particles are gone AND the explosionDuration has passed. But if particles are gone before the duration, the simulation remains in 'EXPLODING' forever. That's a problem.

Therefore, the logic should be: switch to 'RESTARTING' when either all particles are gone OR the explosionDuration has passed.

But how to express that in code? Using an OR condition.

```javascript
if (explosionParticles.length === 0 || Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration) {
    simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
}
```

But in the current code, it's an AND condition. That's incorrect. The simulation should transition to 'RESTARTING' when the explosion animation is done, which is when there are no more particles. However, to avoid the simulation being stuck if particles somehow don't expire (e.g., a programming error), a timeout is provided. Therefore, the correct condition is:

if (explosionParticles.length === 0 || Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration) {
    simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
}

This way, if all particles are gone, regardless of time, the simulation restarts. If the explosionDuration has passed, regardless of particles, the simulation restarts. This prevents the simulation from hanging if particles don't expire for some reason.

But let's verify. Suppose all particles expire at 3 seconds, but explosionDuration is 5 seconds. Then at 3 seconds, particles are gone, so simulation restarts. If particles take longer, say 6 seconds, but explosionDuration is 5 seconds, then at 5 seconds, the simulation restarts regardless. So this OR condition is correct.

Therefore, update the explosion state logic:

```javascript
function updateExploding(dt) {
    for (let particle of explosionParticles) {
        particle.update(dt);
    }

    explosionParticles = explosionParticles.filter(p => p.lifespan > 0);

    if (explosionParticles.length === 0 || Date.now() - explosionStartTime >= explosionDuration) {
        simulationState = 'RESTARTING';
    }
}
```

This ensures that the simulation restarts either when all particles are gone or when the maximum explosion duration is reached.

Now, another aspect: when the simulation restarts, it's important to clear any remaining particles and reset the state properly. In the updateRestarting function, we need to reset vehicles and particles.

Wait, in the current setup, the updateRestarting function checks if enough time has passed since the explosionStartTime (explosionDuration + 2000 ms). But actually, once the simulation enters the 'RESTARTING' state, it should immediately reset the variables and re-initialize the vehicles, then switch back to 'RUNNING'. The delay is not necessary, because the 'RESTARTING' state is already triggered after the explosion animation completes. So perhaps the delay is redundant.

Wait, no. Let's think. When the simulation enters the 'RESTARTING' state, we need to perform some actions (cleaning up, re-initializing) which might take some time. However, in our case, re-initializing the vehicles is instantaneous. Therefore, once the 'RESTARTING' state is entered, we can immediately reset the variables and switch back to 'RUNNING'.

Therefore, the updateRestarting function can be simplified:

```javascript
function updateRestarting(dt) {
    // Reset variables
    vehicles = initializeVehicles(5); // Start with 5 vehicles
    explosionParticles = [];
    simulationState = 'RUNNING';
}
```

But wait, this would mean that as soon as the simulation enters 'RESTARTING', it immediately resets and restarts. However, the transition from 'EXPLODING' to 'RESTARTING' happens when the explosion animation is done. Therefore, the 'RESTARTING' state is just a brief state where the variables are reset, and then it switches back to 'RUNNING'.

But in the current code, the updateRestarting function was checking the time since explosionStartTime and only resetting after an additional 2 seconds. But that's not necessary. The 'RESTARTING' state should be entered when the explosion animation is done, and then in the updateRestarting function, we can immediately reset and switch back to 'RUNNING'.

Therefore, simplifying the updateRestarting function:

```javascript
function updateRestarting(dt) {
    // Perform reset
    vehicles = initializeVehicles(5); // Start with 5 vehicles
    explosionParticles = [];
    simulationState = 'RUNNING';
}
```

This way, as soon as the simulation enters the 'RESTARTING' state, it resets and starts running again. This removes the unnecessary 2-second delay.

Now, another point: when the simulation restarts, the new vehicles are initialized with new random positions and velocities. However, there's a chance that the new vehicles might immediately collide again, causing another explosion. To prevent this, we might want to ensure that the initial positions and velocities are such that vehicles don't start overlapping. However, given the randomness, it's possible but unlikely. The simulation should handle it gracefully by detecting the collision and restarting again.

But to improve the simulation, maybe we can add a check when initializing vehicles to ensure no overlaps. However, since the problem doesn't specify this, it's optional. For the purposes of this project, we can proceed without it.

Now, let's compile all the code snippets into the final solution.

            - The simulation uses a simple rectangle-based collision detection system for vehicles.
            - Explosion particles are created at the center of the overlapping area when a collision occurs.
            - The simulation state management handles transitions between running, exploding, and restarting.
            - The explosion duration is 5 seconds, after which the simulation restarts with new vehicles.
            - The "BOOM" text expands over time to enhance the visual effect.
