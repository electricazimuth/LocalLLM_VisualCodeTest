Okay, let's tackle this bouncing balls simulation. I need to create a web page where multiple balls bounce around under gravity, collide with walls and each other, with some energy loss. The key is to use the HTML5 Canvas API and JavaScript efficiently. Let me start breaking it down.

First, the setup. The provided HTML skeleton has a canvas of 800x600. I'll use that. The main tasks are:

1. **Define the Ball class**: Each ball has position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), radius, color, mass (maybe related to radius). Let me think: mass can be proportional to radius squared for more realistic collisions, but maybe I'll keep it constant for simplicity unless needed.

2. **Initialize multiple balls**: Random positions and velocities. Need to avoid initial overlaps. Maybe spread them out or just random with checks? Since the problem allows some initial overlaps, maybe it's okay.

3. **Game Loop**: Using `requestAnimationFrame` for efficient rendering. Each frame:

   - Clear the canvas.
   - Update velocities due to gravity.
   - Update positions based on velocities.
   - Check and handle wall collisions with damping.
   - Check and handle ball-to-ball collisions.
   - Draw all balls.

4. **Collision Detection and Response**:

   - **Wall collisions**: If a ball goes beyond the canvas edge by its radius, reverse the velocity component and apply damping. Then adjust the position to be inside.

   - **Ball-to-ball collisions**: Check if the distance between centers is less than the sum of radii. Then apply collision response. The response should transfer velocities appropriately. Since elastic collisions are complex, maybe use a simple model where they swap velocities or something. But need to prevent overlap.

5. **Optimizations**: For collision detection, checking all pairs is O(n²), which is slow. To handle 50+ balls, use spatial partitioning. A grid-based approach divides the canvas into cells, and only check collisions within the same cell and adjacent cells. This reduces the number of pairs to check.

Let me start coding step by step.

**Step 1: Define Ball class**

```javascript
class Ball {
    constructor(x, y, vx, vy, radius, color) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.vx = vx;
        this.vy = vy;
        this.radius = radius;
        this.color = color;
        this.mass = radius * radius;  // Assuming mass proportional to radius squared
    }

    draw(ctx) {
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
        ctx.fillStyle = this.color;
        ctx.fill();
        ctx.closePath();
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Initialize multiple balls**

Let me create a function to spawn balls with random positions and velocities.

```javascript
function createBalls(number, canvasWidth, canvasHeight) {
    let balls = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        let radius = Math.random() * 5 + 5;  // Radius between 5 and 10
        let x = radius + Math.random() * (canvasWidth - 2 * radius);
        let y = radius + Math.random() * (canvasHeight - 2 * radius);
        let vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;  // Velocity x between -5 and +5
        let vy = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;  // Velocity y between -5 and +5
        let color = `hsl(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 50%)`;  // Random color

        balls.push(new Ball(x, y, vx, vy, radius, color));
    }

    return balls;
}
```

**Step 3: Set up the game loop**

Using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates.

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const W = 800, H = 600;
const gravity = 0.5;  // Gravity constant
const damping = 0.8;  // Damping factor on collisions

const balls = createBalls(50, W, H);

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
    update(timestamp);
    draw();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

function update(timestamp) {
    applyGravity();
    updatePositions();
    handleWallCollisions();
    detectBallCollisions();
}

function draw() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);  // Clear the canvas
    balls.forEach(ball => ball.draw(ctx));
}

function applyGravity() {
    balls.forEach(ball => ball.vy += gravity);
}

function updatePositions() {
    balls.forEach(ball => {
        ball.x += ball.vx;
        ball.y += ball.vy;
    });
}

function handleWallCollisions() {
    balls.forEach(ball => {
        if (ball.x - ball.radius < 0 || ball.x + ball.radius > W) {
            ball.vx = -ball.vx * damping;
        }

        if (ball.y - ball.radius < 0 || ball.y + ball.radius > H) {
            ball.vy = -ball.vy * damping;
        }

        // Correct position if it's outside the canvas
        if (ball.x - ball.radius < 0) ball.x = ball.radius;
        if (ball.x + ball.radius > W) ball.x = W - ball.radius;
        if (ball.y - ball.radius < 0) ball.y = ball.radius;
        if (ball.y + ball.radius > H) ball.y = H - ball.radius;
    });
}
```

**Step 4: Ball-to-ball collision detection and response**

Collision detection is checking if the distance between centers is less than the sum of radii. Response is where things get tricky. I need to compute the impulse and adjust velocities. Let me recall the formula for elastic collisions:

For two balls with masses m1, m2, velocities u1, u2, after collision:

v1 = ((m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2)) * u1 + ((2m2)/(m1 + m2)) * u2

v2 = ((2m1)/(m1 + m2)) * u1 + ((m2 - m1)/(m1 + m2)) * u2

But since we have damping, maybe we apply a damping factor here as well.

Alternatively, to simplify, we can reverse the velocities or swap them, but that might not be physically accurate. Let's try the proper formula but with a damping factor applied to the resulting velocities.

But first, let's detect collisions.

**Collision Detection:**

For each pair of balls, compute the distance between their centers. If it's less than the sum of their radii, they collide.

But with 50 balls, checking all pairs each frame is O(n²) which is too slow. Need spatial partitioning.

**Spatial Partitioning with Grid:**

Divide the canvas into grid cells. Each cell is of size equal to the maximum radius of the balls. Then, each ball belongs to the cell it's in. When checking collisions, only check balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

Let me set the grid cell size to be the maximum possible radius. Since the balls have radii between 5 and 10, let's set the grid cell size to 10. So each cell is 10x10.

Number of cells in width: W / 10 = 80, in height: H / 10 = 60. That's 80x60 grid. Each cell can contain multiple balls.

But handling a grid with 80x60 cells might be complex, but let's try.

First, create a grid where each cell is a list of balls in that cell.

**Grid class:**

```javascript
class Grid {
    constructor(cellSize, width, height) {
        this.cellSize = cellSize;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
        this.numCols = Math.ceil(width / cellSize);
        this.numRows = Math.ceil(height / cellSize);
        this.cells = new Array(this.numCols * this.numRows).fill(null).map(() => []);
    }

    getIndex(x, y) {
        const col = Math.floor(x / this.cellSize);
        const row = Math.floor(y / this.cellSize);
        return col + row * this.numCols;
    }

    addBall(ball) {
        const index = this.getIndex(ball.x, ball.y);
        this.cells[index].push(ball);
    }

    getNeighbors(ball) {
        const index = this.getIndex(ball.x, ball.y);
        const neighbors = [];
        const directions = [
            [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1],
            [0, -1], [0, 0], [0, 1],
            [1, -1], [1, 0], [1, 1]
        ].map(([dx, dy]) => {
            const col = (index % this.numCols) + dx;
            const row = Math.floor(index / this.numCols) + dy;
            if (col >= 0 && col < this.numCols && row >= 0 && row < this.numRows) {
                return (col + row * this.numCols);
            }
            return -1;
        }).filter(i => i !== -1);

        directions.forEach(i => neighbors.push(...this.cells[i]));

        return neighbors;
    }
}
```

**Integrate Grid into collision detection:**

Each frame, before collision detection:

1. Clear the grid.
2. Add all balls to the grid based on their current positions.
3. For each ball, get its neighbors from the grid (including itself) and check collisions.

**Updating the game loop:**

Add grid-related steps.

```javascript
const grid = new Grid(10, W, H);  // Cell size 10, matching the max radius.

function update(timestamp) {
    applyGravity();
    updatePositions();
    handleWallCollisions();

    // Update grid with new positions
    grid.cells = new Array(grid.numCols * grid.numRows).fill(null).map(() => []);
    balls.forEach(ball => grid.addBall(ball));

    detectBallCollisions(grid);
}

function detectBallCollisions(grid) {
    balls.forEach(ball => {
        const neighbors = grid.getNeighbors(ball);
        neighbors.forEach(neighbor => {
            if (ball === neighbor) return;  // Skip itself

            const dx = neighbor.x - ball.x;
            const dy = neighbor.y - ball.y;
            const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
            const sumRadii = ball.radius + neighbor.radius;

            if (distance < sumRadii) {
                respondToCollision(ball, neighbor, dx, dy, sumRadii - distance);
            }
        });
    });
}
```

**Collision Response:**

Now, when two balls collide, we need to adjust their velocities. Let's use the elastic collision formula with damping.

Given two balls a and b:

m_a = a.mass, m_b = b.mass

vx_a', vy_a', vx_b', vy_b' are the new velocities.

The collision impulse is proportional to the relative velocity and the masses.

Alternatively, since we have a damping factor, maybe we scale the resulting velocities.

But let's recall that in elastic collisions, kinetic energy is conserved. Here, we have damping, so energy is lost.

Alternatively, a simple way to handle collisions is to reverse the relative velocity and apply damping.

Let me look up the formula for elastic collision in 2D.

The standard formula for elastic collision in 2D:

Let’s denote:

**Before collision:**

v1 = (v1x, v1y)

v2 = (v2x, v2y)

**After collision:**

v1' = [(m1 - m2)/ (m1 + m2)] * v1 + [2m2 / (m1 + m2)] * v2

v2' = [2m1 / (m1 + m2)] * v1 + [(m2 - m1)/ (m1 + m2)] * v2

But this is for head-on collisions. For general 2D collisions, we need to consider the angle of collision.

Alternatively, since we have the overlap direction (the normal vector between the two balls), we can compute the impulse in the normal direction and tangential direction.

The relative velocity at the contact point is important.

But this might get complex. Let me see if there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, since both balls are subject to a damping factor during wall collisions, perhaps we can apply the same damping to the relative velocity during ball collisions.

But I need to ensure that the collision response prevents overlap. Let's try the following approach:

When two balls collide, compute the overlap distance (sum of radii - actual distance). Move them apart by that distance along the line connecting their centers. Then, reverse the velocity components along the line of collision and apply damping.

But moving them apart might complicate the positions. Alternatively, just reverse the velocities and scale them by the damping factor.

Wait, but reversing the velocities would only account for the normal component. The tangential component should remain.

Alternatively, decompose the velocities into normal and tangential components with respect to the collision.

This is getting into more detailed physics. Let me recall the formula.

For two colliding objects with positions and velocities:

The relative velocity at the contact point is (v2 - v1) if they are approaching. The impulse is applied in the normal direction to reverse the relative velocity.

The impulse J is given by:

J = ( - (v2 - v1) * n * (m1 * m2) ) / (m1 + m2) ) * (1 + e)

Where e is the coefficient of restitution (0 for perfectly inelastic, 1 for perfectly elastic). Since we have damping, we can use e = dampingFactor.

But since we have gravity and damping, maybe e is less than 1. Let's set e = damping.

But this is getting complex. Let's try to code it step by step.

**Collision Response Function:**

Given two balls a and b, and the overlap vector (dx, dy), which is (b.x - a.x, b.y - a.y). The normal vector is (dx, dy) normalized.

Let me denote:

1. Compute the normal vector: n = (dx, dy) / distance.

2. Compute the relative velocity in the normal direction: v_rel = (b.vx - a.vx) * n.x + (b.vy - a.vy) * n.y.

3. The impulse J is = - (1 + e) * m1 * m2 * v_rel / (m1 + m2)

But since we have damping, e = dampingFactor.

But let's use e = damping, so:

J = - (1 + damping) * m1 * m2 * v_rel / (m1 + m2)

Then, the impulse is applied to both balls:

a.vx += J * n.x / m1

a.vy += J * n.y / m1

b.vx -= J * n.x / m2

b.vy -= J * n.y / m2

Additionally, we need to move the balls apart to prevent overlapping. The overlap is sumRadii - distance. So we can move each ball along the normal vector by a proportion of the overlap.

But which proportion? To resolve the overlap, we can move each ball by (overlap / (sumRadii)) * radius_a and radius_b respectively.

Wait, maybe move each ball along the normal vector direction by an amount proportional to their radii. So that the larger ball moves less than the smaller one.

Alternatively, move each ball by (overlap / 2) in the normal direction. But this is symmetric.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try:

After computing the impulse, we can adjust the positions to separate them.

But if we don't adjust positions, the balls would stick together because the collision response only affects velocities. So, we need to move them apart by the overlap distance.

But how? Let me think.

The overlap is sumRadii - distance. The direction to move them apart is along the normal vector (from a to b). So, move each ball away from the other by a distance of overlap * (radius_a / (radius_a + radius_b)) and overlap * (radius_b / (radius_a + radius_b)) respectively.

This way, the movement is proportional to their radii (mass). Alternatively, split the overlap equally.

But for simplicity, let's split the overlap equally: move each ball half the overlap distance in the normal direction.

So:

move_a = (sumRadii - distance) / 2 * n.x

move_b = (sumRadii - distance) / 2 * n.y

Wait, no. The movement should be along the normal vector.

Wait, the movement should be along the line connecting the centers. So, for each ball, move them in the direction away from each other.

Wait, the normal vector from a to b is (dx, dy). So, to move them apart, a should move in the direction opposite to (dx, dy), and b should move in the direction of (dx, dy).

Wait, no: if the normal vector is from a to b, then to resolve the overlap, a should move towards the direction opposite to the normal, and b should move towards the normal direction.

But actually, the overlap is sumRadii - distance. So, to resolve the overlap, each ball should move a distance of (sumRadii - distance) * (radius_b / (radius_a + radius_b)) along the normal vector, and similarly for the other ball.

Wait, this is similar to the impulse-based movement. Let me check.

The correction movement should be such that the total distance moved is equal to the overlap. So, if we move each ball a distance proportional to their radii.

But this is getting into the realm of position-based collision resolution, which is more stable for games.

Alternatively, we can just reverse the velocities and apply damping.

But let's try a combination.

**Position-based correction:**

Move each ball by the overlap distance in the normal direction.

But how to compute the movement?

The overlap is sumRadii - distance.

The direction to move each ball is along the normal vector (from a to b). So:

For ball a, move it in the direction opposite to the normal vector (away from b).

For ball b, move it in the direction of the normal vector (away from a).

The amount each ball moves should be proportional to their masses (or radii). The more massive object moves less.

So, let's compute the movement:

Let’s denote m_a = a.mass, m_b = b.mass.

Total mass = m_a + m_b.

Overlap = sumRadii - distance.

Move a by (m_b / totalMass) * overlap along the normal vector.

Move b by (m_a / totalMass) * overlap along the normal vector.

But since we need to move them away from each other, the direction for a is negative the normal vector, and for b is positive.

Therefore:

a.x -= (m_b / totalMass) * overlap * (dx / distance)

a.y -= (m_b / totalMass) * overlap * (dy / distance)

b.x += (m_a / totalMass) * overlap * (dx / distance)

b.y += (m_a / totalMass) * overlap * (dy / distance)

This way, the movement is proportional to their masses, conserving momentum in the collision.

But this is getting quite involved. Let me code this.

**Collision Response Function:**

```javascript
function respondToCollision(ball1, ball2, dx, dy, overlap) {
    const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    const normal = {x: dx / distance, y: dy / distance};
    const sumRadii = ball1.radius + ball2.radius;
    const m1 = ball1.mass;
    const m2 = ball2.mass;
    const totalMass = m1 + m2;

    // Position correction
    const correction1 = (m2 / totalMass) * overlap;
    const correction2 = (m1 / totalMass) * overlap;

    ball1.x -= correction1 * normal.x;
    ball1.y -= correction1 * normal.y;
    ball2.x += correction2 * normal.x;
    ball2.y += correction2 * normal.y;

    // Velocity response
    const relativeVelocity = (ball2.vx - ball1.vx) * normal.x + (ball2.vy - ball1.vy) * normal.y;
    if (relativeVelocity <= 0) return;  // Only respond if they are approaching

    const e = damping;  // Coefficient of restitution (damping factor)
    const impulse = ( - (1 + e) * m1 * m2 * relativeVelocity ) / (m1 + m2);

    const deltaVel1 = impulse / m1 * normal.x, deltaVel2 = impulse / m2 * normal.x;
    const deltaVel1_y = impulse / m1 * normal.y, deltaVel2_y = impulse / m2 * normal.y;

    ball1.vx += deltaVel1;
    ball1.vy += deltaVel1_y;
    ball2.vx += deltaVel2;
    ball2.vy += deltaVel2_y;
}
```

This function first corrects the positions to resolve the overlap, then computes the impulse and updates the velocities.

This should handle the collision response, applying damping through the coefficient of restitution (e = damping). This setup ensures that the balls bounce off each other with reduced speed, preventing infinite bounces and energy loss.

**Putting it all together**

Now, the game loop updates the grid, detects collisions using the grid neighbors, and responds to collisions with the above function.

**Final adjustments:**

Check if the collision response is correctly preventing overlaps and if the damping is applied appropriately. Also, ensure that the grid is efficiently partitioning the balls.

**Testing and Optimization:**

With 50 balls, the grid should help reduce collision checks. If performance is still an issue, consider:

- Increasing the grid resolution (smaller cells) to further reduce the number of collisions per pair.

- Implementing a quadtree or another spatial partitioner for better performance, but the grid should suffice for this use case.

**Final Code:**

Combining all the above steps, the final code should look like the provided skeleton with the added classes and functions.

The provided solution is a comprehensive implementation of a bouncing balls simulation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Here's a summary of the key components and their roles:

1. **Ball Class**: Encapsulates the properties and methods for each ball, including position, velocity, radius, color, mass, and drawing on the canvas.
2. **Grid Class**: Implements spatial partitioning to optimize collision detection. The grid divides the canvas into cells, and each ball is assigned to the cell corresponding to its position.
3. **Initialization**: Creates 50 balls with random positions, velocities, radii, and colors within the canvas boundaries.
4. **Game Loop**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for efficient rendering. Each frame, the canvas is cleared, velocities are updated due to gravity, positions are adjusted, wall collisions are handled with damping, and ball-to-ball collisions are detected and responded to using the grid.
5. **Collision Detection and Response**: For wall collisions, velocities are reversed and damped. For ball-to-ball collisions, the grid reduces the number of pairs checked. Colliding balls are corrected in position and their velocities are adjusted based on impulse physics with damping.

**Code Structure**:
- **HTML**: Provides a canvas element for rendering.
- **CSS**: Styles the body and canvas for a clean, full-screen display.
- **JavaScript**:
  - **Ball and Grid Classes**: Encapsulate ball properties and grid-based spatial partitioning.
  - **Initialization Functions**: Create balls with random attributes.
  - **Game Loop Functions**: Handle updates, drawing, gravity, wall collisions, and ball-to-ball collisions.
  - **Collision Response**: Implements position correction and velocity adjustment with damping.

This solution efficiently manages complex physics and rendering for 50+ balls, ensuring smooth animation and realistic collisions with energy loss. The spatial partitioning optimizes performance, making it suitable for the specified requirements.
