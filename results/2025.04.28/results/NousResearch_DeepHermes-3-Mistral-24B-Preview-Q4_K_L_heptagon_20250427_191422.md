Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to create a webgame where 20 balls bounce inside a spinning heptagon container. The balls need to be affected by gravity, collide with each other and the walls, and lose energy upon collision. Also, the heptagon spins around its center at 360 degrees every 5 seconds. 

First, I need to outline the steps. Let's start with the HTML and Canvas setup. The skeleton provided has a canvas with a certain width and height. I'll use that. The next part is drawing the heptagon. Heptagons are polygons with seven sides. To draw a spinning heptagon, I'll need to calculate the points of the heptagon and rotate them over time.

For the heptagon, I should calculate the vertices based on the radius. Let's say the radius is such that the heptagon fits inside the canvas. The center is at (W/2, H/2). Each vertex is determined by angle increments of 2π/7 radians. To spin the heptagon, I'll rotate all the vertices by a certain angle each frame. The rotation speed is 360 degrees every 5 seconds, so each frame's rotation angle depends on the time delta.

Next, the balls. Each ball needs to have properties like position, velocity, radius, color, mass, etc. The colors are given in an array. The numbers on the balls can be drawn as text inside each circle. The radius should be the same for all balls, so maybe 10 pixels? But need to ensure that 20 balls can fit inside the heptagon. The heptagon's size must be larger than the balls' combined sizes.

Gravity will affect the vertical velocity. Each frame, we add gravity to the vertical velocity. Friction might be part of the damping when collisions happen. Damping is applied when the ball hits a wall or another ball. So after a collision, the velocity is reduced by a damping factor (like 0.95).

Collision detection between balls is crucial. The naive approach is O(n²), which is slow for 20 balls. To optimize, maybe use a spatial partitioning method like a grid. Divide the canvas into cells, and check collisions only within the same cell and adjacent cells. This reduces the number of checks.

For each ball, update their position based on velocity. Then check for collisions with the heptagon's walls. The heptagon's walls are the edges between the vertices. So for each edge, check if the ball's position is on the wrong side of the edge, considering the radius. If so, resolve the collision. Reverse the velocity component perpendicular to the edge, apply damping, and adjust the position to be just inside the heptagon.

Ball-to-ball collisions: For each pair of balls, check if their distance is less than the sum of their radii. Since all balls have the same radius, the distance check is straightforward. Then calculate the collision response. Since it's a 2D collision with restitution, the velocities need to be adjusted. The formula for elastic collision involves the relative velocity, the normal vector, and the restitution coefficient. But since we have damping, the coefficient should be less than 1. However, implementing perfect elastic collisions is complex. A simplified approach is to swap velocities along the collision normal and apply damping.

The animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame. Each frame, clear the canvas, rotate the heptagon, update ball positions and velocities, check collisions, and draw everything.

Drawing the balls: For each ball, draw a filled circle with the given color. Then, draw the number on top. The number's position should be centered. Maybe adjust the font size based on the ball's radius.

Handling the heptagon's rotation: Each frame, calculate the current rotation angle based on the time passed. The rotation speed is 360 degrees per 5 seconds. So the angular velocity is 360/5 = 72 degrees per second. Converting that to radians per second: 72 * π/180 = 1.2566 radians per second. So each frame, the rotation angle increases by angular velocity * deltaTime (time since last frame).

Now, let's outline the steps in code.

1. **Heptagon Calculation:**
   - Calculate the vertices of the heptagon. The radius should be such that the heptagon fits in the canvas. Let's say the radius is 200 pixels. The center is (250, 250) if the canvas is 500x500.
   - Each vertex is (centerX + radius * cos(theta), centerY + radius * sin(theta)), where theta starts at 0 and increases by 2π/7 each time.
   - Rotate all vertices by the current rotation angle (theta_rot) each frame.

2. **Ball Objects:**
   - Each ball has x, y, vx, vy, radius, color, mass, number.
   - Radius is same for all. Let's use 10 pixels. Then the heptagon radius needs to be larger than the sum of the ball radius and the distance from center to the edge. So maybe heptagon radius is 200 pixels. The distance from center to wall is 200 - 10 = 190 pixels. So the balls can't go beyond 190 pixels from center.

3. **Gravity:**
   - Vertical acceleration. Let's use a gravity of 0.1 pixels per frame². So each frame, vy += gravity.

4. **Animation Loop:**
   - Use requestAnimationFrame.
   - Clear canvas.
   - Update heptagon rotation based on time.
   - Update each ball's position (x += vx, y += vy).
   - Check collisions with heptagon walls.
   - Check collisions between balls.
   - Draw the heptagon.
   - Draw all balls.

5. **Heptagon Wall Collision:**
   - For each ball, check against each edge of the heptagon.
   - Each edge is between two consecutive vertices. For each edge, check if the ball is on the outside of the edge, considering the radius.
   - If collision, reverse the velocity component perpendicular to the edge, apply damping, and push the ball back inside.

6. **Ball-Ball Collision:**
   - For each pair of balls, check if distance between centers is <= 2*radius.
   - If collision, resolve by swapping velocities along the collision normal and applying damping.

7. **Spatial Partitioning:**
   - Divide the canvas into a grid. For each cell, store the balls in that cell. When checking collisions, only check balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

8. **Drawing:**
   - Draw the heptagon using the rotated vertices.
   - For each ball, draw a circle and the number.

Now, let's think about possible issues.

- **Heptagon Collision Detection:** The edges are straight lines. For a ball, the collision is when the ball's position plus its radius is outside the heptagon. But since the heptagon is rotating, the edges' equations change each frame.

- **Edge Equations:** Each edge can be represented as a line segment. The line equation can be calculated, and the distance from the ball's center to the line is checked. If the distance is less than the radius, and the ball is on the outside of the edge, then collision occurs.

But handling all edges for each ball could be computationally expensive. Maybe optimize by checking edges near the ball's current position.

Alternatively, for each ball, check all edges. Since there are only 7 edges, even 20 balls would check 140 edges per frame, which is manageable.

For each edge, the line equation can be determined using the two vertices. Then, for a point (x, y), determine which side of the line it is. If it's outside, and the distance from the point to the line is <= radius, then collision.

The normal vector of the edge can be used to compute the velocity component perpendicular to the edge. Then reverse that component, apply damping, and adjust the position.

But calculating the normal for each edge might be needed. Alternatively, using the edge's direction vector to find the normal.

Another approach is to find the closest point on the edge to the ball's center. If the distance is less than the radius, and the ball is outside the heptagon, then collision.

But this might be complex. Alternatively, for each edge, check if the ball's position is outside the edge's line, considering the radius.

So for each edge:

1. Check if the ball is on the outside of the edge (the side opposite to the center).

2. Calculate the distance from the ball's center to the edge's line.

3. If the distance is <= radius, then collision.

But the edge is a segment, so the ball's center must be outside the edge's line, and the closest point on the line segment to the ball's center must be between the two vertices.

This is more accurate but computationally heavier.

Alternatively, approximate by checking all edges and assuming the ball is outside the heptagon if any edge is crossed.

But this might not be accurate. Hmm.

Maybe the correct approach is to check for each edge whether the ball's position plus its radius is outside the edge's line. But considering the edge's normal direction.

Alternatively, since the heptagon is convex, the ball is outside if it's outside any edge.

But how to check that.

Alternatively, use the distance from the center. If the distance from the center to the ball's center is greater than the heptagon's radius minus the ball's radius, then the ball is outside. But this is a rough approximation and doesn't account for the edge direction.

So perhaps the correct way is to check each edge.

Let's outline the steps for a single edge:

Given two vertices (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), compute the line equation.

The line can be represented as ax + by + c = 0.

Compute a, b, c.

The normal vector is (a, b), direction (b, -a).

The sign of ax0 + by0 + c determines which side of the line the point (x0, y0) is on.

If the ball's center is on the side opposite to the heptagon's interior, then it's outside.

But the heptagon's edges are oriented such that the interior is on one side.

So for each edge, compute the normal vector pointing inward.

Then, for the ball's center, compute the distance to the edge's line. If the distance is <= radius, and the ball is on the outside side of the edge, then collision.

So the steps:

For each edge:

1. Compute the line equation.

2. Compute the normal vector pointing inward.

3. Check if the ball's center is on the outside of the edge (i.e., the sign of ax + by + c is positive or negative, depending on the normal direction).

4. Compute the distance from the ball's center to the line. If distance <= radius and the ball is on the outside, then collision.

If collision, then reverse the velocity component in the direction of the normal, apply damping, and adjust the position to be just inside the edge.

This seems manageable.

For the velocity component, the normal vector is (a, b). The velocity vector is (vx, vy). The component along the normal is (vx*a + vy*b) / sqrt(a² + b²). The direction of the normal is (a, b) if the edge is oriented outward. Wait, no. The normal vector pointing inward would be (a, b) if the edge is oriented such that the interior is on the left side.

Wait, the line equation ax + by + c = 0. The normal vector is (a, b). The direction of the normal depends on the sign of a and b. So to get the inward normal, we need to ensure that the normal points towards the interior of the heptagon.

Alternatively, since the heptagon is convex, all edges have their normals pointing inward. So for each edge, the normal vector is (a, b), but we need to ensure that it's pointing towards the interior. So perhaps when calculating the normal, we can adjust the direction based on the orientation of the edge.

Alternatively, compute the edge direction vector (dx, dy) = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1). The normal vector is (-dy, dx) (which is perpendicular and points to the left of the direction) or (dy, -dx) (points to the right). To get the inward normal, we need to check the orientation.

This might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, for each edge, compute the normal vector as (-dy, dx) which points to the left of the edge direction. But depending on the edge's orientation, this might be inward or outward.

Alternatively, compute the normal vector as (y2 - y1, x1 - x2). Wait, perhaps the cross product approach.

The normal vector pointing inward can be determined by the cross product of the edge direction vector with a vector pointing from the edge to the center.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, for each edge, compute the normal vector as (y2 - y1, x1 - x2). Let's see.

Take edge from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). The direction vector is (dx, dy) = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1). The normal vector can be (dy, -dx) or (-dy, dx). Let's pick (-dy, dx) as the normal vector. Then, to check if the normal points inward, we can see if the dot product with a vector from the edge to the center is positive.

For example, take a point on the edge, say (x1, y1). The vector from this point to the center is (cx - x1, cy - y1). The normal vector is (-dy, dx). The dot product is (-dy)(cx - x1) + dx(cy - y1). If this is positive, then the normal points towards the center.

Wait, let's compute:

Normal vector is (-dy, dx).

Vector from edge point to center: (cx - x1, cy - y1).

Dot product: (-dy)(cx - x1) + dx(cy - y1) = -dy(cx - x1) + dx(cy - y1).

If this is positive, then the normal points towards the center. Otherwise, away.

So, for each edge, compute this dot product. If positive, the normal (-dy, dx) is inward. If negative, the inward normal is (dy, -dx).

So, for each edge, compute the normal vector as either (-dy, dx) or (dy, -dx) based on the dot product above.

Once the inward normal is determined, then for any point, the distance to the edge's line can be calculated, and the side can be determined.

So, steps for edge collision:

For each edge:

1. Compute dx = x2 - x1, dy = y2 - y1.

2. Compute the normal vector as (-dy, dx).

3. Compute the vector from edge point (x1, y1) to center (cx, cy): (cx - x1, cy - y1).

4. Dot product with normal: (-dy)(cx - x1) + dx(cy - y1).

   If this is positive, then (-dy, dx) is the inward normal.

   Else, the inward normal is (dy, -dx).

5. Once the inward normal is determined, for a ball's center (bx, by), compute the distance to the edge's line.

   The line equation is a(x - x1) + b(y - y1) = 0, where (a, b) is the direction vector (dx, dy). Wait, no. The line equation can be written as ax + by + c = 0, where (a, b) is perpendicular to the direction vector.

Wait, perhaps better to use the formula for distance from a point to a line.

The line through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be represented as:

(a(x - x1) + b(y - y1)) = 0, where (a, b) is the direction vector (dx, dy). Wait, no. The line can be represented parametrically as x = x1 + t*dx, y = y1 + t*dy.

But to compute the distance from a point (bx, by) to this line, we can use the formula:

distance = | ( (x2 - x1)(y1 - by) - (y2 - y1)(x1 - bx) ) | / sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 )

This formula gives the distance from the point to the line. The sign indicates which side the point is on. The denominator is the length of the direction vector.

So, for the edge between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance from (bx, by) to the line is:

distance = Math.abs( (dx*(y1 - by) - dy*(x1 - bx)) ) / Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)

The sign of (dx*(y1 - by) - dy*(x1 - bx)) indicates which side the point is on. If the sign matches the inward normal, then the point is inside; otherwise, outside.

Wait, the formula (dx*(y1 - by) - dy*(x1 - bx)) is equal to the determinant:

| dx   dy |
| x1-bx y1-by |

Which is the signed distance multiplied by the denominator. So the sign of this determinant tells us which side the point is on.

If the determinant is positive, the point is on the side of the normal vector. If the normal vector is inward, then a positive determinant means the point is inside.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

If the normal vector is inward, then the direction in which the normal points is towards the interior. So if the point is on the same side as the normal, it's inside.

But the determinant's sign depends on the direction of the normal. Let me take an example.

Suppose the edge is from (0,0) to (1,0). The direction vector is (1,0). The normal vector inward could be (0,1) or (0,-1). Let's say the heptagon is above the x-axis, so the inward normal is (0,1).

A point above the edge (like (0.5, 0.5)) would have a positive determinant.

So determinant = dx*(y1 - by) - dy*(x1 - bx) = 1*(0 - 0.5) - 0*(0 - 0.5) = -0.5.

Wait, no. Let's plug in:

dx = 1, dy = 0.

y1 = 0, by = 0.5.

x1 = 0, bx = 0.5.

So determinant = 1*(0 - 0.5) - 0*(0 - 0.5) = -0.5.

The absolute value is 0.5, which is the distance. The sign is negative. So if the inward normal is (0,1), then a negative determinant means the point is on the same side as the normal (inside).

Wait, no. The determinant is negative, which would mean the point is on the side opposite to the normal. Because the normal points upward (0,1), so the determinant is negative implies the point is below the edge, which is outside if the heptagon is above.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reverse the sign.

Alternatively, the sign of the determinant tells us which side of the line the point is on. If the determinant is positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other.

But the direction of the normal vector is important. Let's say the normal vector is (a, b). Then, the sign of (a*(bx - x1) + b*(by - y1)) would indicate the side.

Wait, another formula:

The formula for the signed distance is (a*(bx - x1) + b*(by - y1)) / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).

But (a, b) is the normal vector. So if the normal vector is pointing inward, then the signed distance is positive if the point is inside.

But I'm getting confused. Let's take an example.

Edge from (0,0) to (1,0). Inward normal is (0,1). So a=0, b=1.

Point (0.5, 0.5):

Signed distance = (0*(0.5 - 0) + 1*(0.5 - 0)) / sqrt(0+1) = 0.5 / 1 = 0.5.

But the distance is 0.5, which is correct. The sign is positive, meaning the point is on the same side as the normal, which is the interior. So yes, the signed distance formula using the inward normal gives positive when the point is inside.

But wait, the formula is (a*(bx - x1) + b*(by - y1)) / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).

So for the point (0.5, 0.5), x1=0, y1=0.

a=0, b=1.

So (0*(0.5 - 0) + 1*(0.5 - 0)) = 0.5. The denominator is 1.

So signed distance is 0.5. Positive, meaning the point is inside.

So if the signed distance is positive, the point is inside.

But the distance from the point to the line is the absolute value. So if the signed distance is positive and greater than the ball's radius, the ball is outside the heptagon.

Wait, but in this case, the signed distance is 0.5, which is the distance from the point to the line. If the ball's radius is, say, 0.3, then the ball is outside because the distance is 0.5 > 0.3.

Wait, no. If the signed distance is positive (inside), and the distance is 0.5, then the ball's center is inside the heptagon, but the ball's radius is 0.3. So the ball's edge is at 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8, which is outside. Wait, no. The ball's center is at 0.5, 0.5. The distance to the edge is 0.5. So the ball's edge reaches 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2 (but no, the distance is the distance from the center to the line. The actual distance from the edge of the ball to the line is the distance from the center minus the radius. Wait, no. The distance from the center is 0.5. The radius is 0.3. So the distance from the edge of the ball to the line is 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2. If 0.2 > 0, then the ball is inside. If 0.5 - 0.3 <= 0, then the ball is outside.

Wait, no. The distance from the center is 0.5. The radius is 0.3. So the ball's edge is 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2 away from the line. Wait, no. If the distance from the center is 0.5, then the distance from the edge of the ball to the line is 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2. So if that's positive, the ball is inside. If it's negative, the ball is outside.

So, the condition for collision is:

signed_distance <= radius.

But wait, the signed_distance is the distance from the center to the line. So if the center is inside (signed_distance positive), then the distance from the edge of the ball to the line is signed_distance - radius. If that's <= 0, then the ball is outside.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If the center is inside (signed_distance > 0), then the distance from the center to the line is signed_distance. The ball's radius is r. So the distance from the ball's edge to the line is signed_distance - r. If this is <= 0, then the ball is outside the heptagon.

If the center is outside (signed_distance < 0), then the distance from the center to the line is -signed_distance. The distance from the ball's edge to the line is -signed_distance - r. If this is <= 0, then the ball is outside.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is:

If the ball's center is on the outside of the edge (signed_distance < 0), and the distance from the center to the line is <= radius, then collision.

But the distance from the center to the line is |signed_distance|. So if the center is outside (signed_distance < 0), then the distance is -signed_distance. So if -signed_distance <= radius, then collision.

So the collision condition is:

if (signed_distance < 0 && -signed_distance <= radius) then collision.

Alternatively, if the distance from the center to the line is <= radius, and the center is on the outside side.

So:

distance = Math.abs(signed_distance);

if (distance <= radius && signed_distance < 0) then collision.

Yes, that makes sense.

So for each edge:

1. Compute signed_distance = (a*(bx - x1) + b*(by - y1)) / sqrt(a² + b²), where (a, b) is the inward normal.

Wait, no. The formula for signed_distance using the inward normal is (a*(bx - x1) + b*(by - y1)) / sqrt(a² + b²). This is positive if the point is inside, negative if outside.

So the distance is Math.abs(signed_distance). If signed_distance is negative (outside) and distance <= radius, then collision.

So the steps:

For each edge:

Compute the inward normal vector (a, b).

Compute signed_distance = (a*(bx - x1) + b*(by - y1)) / sqrt(a² + b²).

distance = Math.abs(signed_distance).

If (signed_distance < 0 && distance <= radius):

   Collision occurs.

Once collision is detected, we need to resolve it by moving the ball back inside and reflecting the velocity.

The reflection would involve reversing the velocity component along the normal direction.

The new velocity component is the current velocity minus 2 times the component along the normal. So:

vx_new = vx - 2 * (vx * a + vy * b) * a / (a² + b²)

vy_new = vy - 2 * (vx * a + vy * b) * b / (a² + b²)

But also apply damping. So after reflection, multiply by damping factor.

Also, move the ball back to a position just inside the edge.

To move the ball back, we can move it along the normal direction by an amount equal to the penetration depth (distance - radius).

Wait, no. The penetration depth is distance (which is the distance from the center to the line) minus the radius.

If the distance is the distance from the center to the line, then the penetration is distance - radius.

But since the center is outside, distance is -signed_distance.

So penetration = distance - radius = (-signed_distance) - radius = - (signed_distance + radius).

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, the center is outside, so signed_distance is negative.

distance = Math.abs(signed_distance) = -signed_distance.

So penetration is distance (from center to line) minus radius.

But since the center is outside, the penetration is (distance) - radius.

But if the ball is colliding, then distance <= radius.

So penetration = distance - radius.

But if distance <= radius, then penetration is <= 0.

Wait, no. For example, if distance is 0.5 and radius is 0.3, then penetration is 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2. But the center is outside, so the ball's edge is at distance 0.5, which is 0.2 beyond the line. So the penetration is the amount by which the ball's edge extends into the interior. But since the center is outside, the ball is partially inside.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct way to move the ball back is to move it along the normal direction by an amount equal to the penetration.

But the penetration is the distance from the line to the ball's edge. Since the center is outside, the distance from the center to the line is distance = -signed_distance. The distance from the ball's edge to the line is distance - radius.

If distance - radius <= 0, then the ball is outside, and the penetration is -(distance - radius) = radius - distance.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase.

The distance from the center to the line is distance = Math.abs(signed_distance).

If the center is outside (signed_distance < 0), then the distance from the center to the line is distance = -signed_distance.

The distance from the ball's edge to the line is distance - radius.

If this is <= 0, then the ball is outside.

The penetration is the amount by which the ball's edge is inside the heptagon. So penetration = radius - (distance - radius) = 2 * radius - distance.

Wait, no. Let me take an example.

Suppose the distance from the center is 0.5, radius is 0.3. The distance from the edge to the line is 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2. So the penetration is 0.2. The ball is 0.2 units inside the line. So to move it back, we need to move it along the normal direction by 0.2 units away from the line.

But the normal direction is pointing inward. So to move the ball outside, we need to move it along the inward normal direction by the penetration amount.

So the new position is:

bx_new = bx - penetration * (a / sqrt(a² + b²))

by_new = by - penetration * (b / sqrt(a² + b²))

Wait, because the normal vector is (a, b), which is inward. So to move the ball outside, we need to move in the direction opposite to the normal.

So the unit normal vector is (a, b) / sqrt(a² + b²).

So the adjustment is:

bx_new = bx - penetration * (a / sqrt(a² + b²))

by_new = by - penetration * (b / sqrt(a² + b²))

But penetration is the amount the ball's edge is inside. So penetration = radius - (distance - radius) = 2 * radius - distance.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

If the center is outside, the distance from center to line is distance = -signed_distance.

The distance from the edge to the line is distance - radius.

If this is negative, then the ball is outside. The penetration is the amount the edge is inside, which is radius - (distance - radius) = 2 * radius - distance.

Wait, if distance is 0.5 (center is outside), radius is 0.3.

distance from edge to line is 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2.

The penetration is 0.2. So the ball is 0.2 units inside the line.

So to move it back, we need to move along the normal direction (inward) by 0.2 units.

But wait, the normal is inward. So moving in the normal direction would take the ball further inside. But we want to move it outside.

So the correct direction is opposite to the normal.

So the adjustment is:

bx_new = bx + penetration * (a / sqrt(a² + b²))

by_new = by + penetration * (b / sqrt(a² + b²))

But penetration is 0.2.

So the ball is moved along the outward normal direction by 0.2 units.

But how to compute penetration.

Wait, the penetration is the distance from the edge to the line. Since the edge is outside, the edge is on the outside side. So the penetration is the distance from the edge to the line, which is distance - radius.

But if the ball is outside, distance is greater than radius.

Wait, no. If the ball is colliding, distance <= radius.

Wait, the collision condition is distance <= radius and signed_distance < 0.

So for example, if distance is 0.5 and radius is 0.3, then the ball is outside, and distance > radius. But according to the collision condition, distance <= radius. So this example doesn't collide.

If distance is 0.2 and radius is 0.3, then the ball is inside (since distance <= radius). But signed_distance is positive (inside), so no collision.

If distance is 0.4 and radius is 0.3, then the ball is outside (distance > radius), so no collision.

If distance is 0.2 and signed_distance is negative (outside), then the ball is outside, and distance <= radius. So collision occurs.

In that case, the penetration is distance (0.2) - radius (0.3) = -0.1. So the edge is 0.1 units inside the line.

So the penetration is 0.1 units (the amount the edge is inside).

To move the ball back, we need to move it along the normal direction (inward) by the penetration amount. Wait, but the normal is inward. So moving inward would take the ball further inside, but we want to move it outside.

No, wait. If the penetration is the amount the edge is inside, then to move the ball outside, we need to move it outward along the normal by the penetration amount.

So the adjustment is:

bx_new = bx + penetration * (a / sqrt(a² + b²))

by_new = by + penetration * (b / sqrt(a² + b²))

But penetration is the distance from the edge to the line, which is distance - radius. Since distance is the distance from the center to the line, and the ball is outside, distance = -signed_distance.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let's think differently.

Once a collision is detected (center is outside and distance <= radius), the penetration is the distance from the edge to the line. Since the center is outside, the edge is distance - radius units away from the line.

If distance <= radius, then distance - radius <= 0. So the edge is inside the line.

So the penetration is the amount the edge is inside, which is radius - (distance - radius) = 2*radius - distance.

But since distance <= radius, this is positive.

So penetration = radius - (distance - radius) = 2 * radius - distance.

But distance is the distance from the center to the line, which is -signed_distance (since signed_distance is negative).

distance = -signed_distance.

penetration = 2 * radius - distance.

But distance = -signed_distance.

penetration = 2 * radius - (-signed_distance) = 2 * radius + signed_distance.

But signed_distance is negative, so 2*radius + signed_distance = radius - (distance - radius).

Yes, that's correct.

But how to compute this.

Alternatively, penetration = radius - (distance - radius) = 2 * radius - distance.

But distance = Math.abs(signed_distance).

But signed_distance is negative.

So distance = -signed_distance.

penetration = 2*radius - distance.

But distance = -signed_distance.

So penetration = 2*radius - (-signed_distance) = 2*radius + signed_distance.

But signed_distance is negative, so penetration = 2*radius + signed_distance.

But since signed_distance is negative, and distance = -signed_distance, which is >= radius (because collision condition is distance <= radius). So distance = -signed_distance <= radius.

So signed_distance <= -radius.

So penetration = 2*radius - distance = 2*radius - (-signed_distance) = 2*radius + signed_distance.

But signed_distance <= -radius, so 2*radius + signed_distance <= 2*radius - radius = radius.

So penetration is between 0 and radius.

So the penetration is the amount the edge is inside.

To move the ball back, we need to move along the outward normal direction by penetration.

The outward normal direction is (a, b) if the inward normal is (-a, b), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the inward normal is (a, b). So the outward normal is (-a, -b).

But the direction to move the ball back is along the outward normal.

So the unit outward normal is (-a, -b) / sqrt(a² + b²).

So the adjustment is:

bx_new = bx + penetration * (-a) / sqrt(a² + b²)

by_new = by + penetration * (-b) / sqrt(a² + b²)

But penetration is the amount the edge is inside.

So yes, moving along the outward normal by penetration units.

So in code:

penetration = 2 * radius - distance;

bx += (a / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration;

by += (b / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration;

Wait, but the normal is inward. So moving along the inward normal by penetration would push the ball further inside. But we want to push it outside.

Wait, no. The inward normal points towards the interior. So to move the ball outside, we need to move in the opposite direction, which is the outward normal.

So the adjustment should be:

bx += (a / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration;  // but inward direction

No, that's wrong. Because the inward normal is (a, b). To move outward, we need to move in the direction opposite to the inward normal. So:

bx += (a / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration * (-1);

by += (b / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration * (-1);

So the adjustment is:

bx -= (a / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration;

by -= (b / sqrt(a² + b²)) * penetration;

Wait, let's see. The inward normal is (a, b). To move outward, we subtract the penetration multiplied by the inward normal unit vector.

Yes.

So the code would be:

dx = x2 - x1;

dy = y2 - y1;

a = dy; // inward normal (assuming we have already determined the inward normal as (dy, -dx) or something else)

b = -dx;

// compute signed_distance

signed_distance = (a * (bx - x1) + b * (by - y1)) / Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b);

distance = Math.abs(signed_distance);

if (signed_distance < 0 && distance <= radius) {

    // collision

    // compute penetration

    penetration = 2 * radius - distance;

    // move ball back along inward normal direction?

    // no, wait, inward normal is (a, b). To move outward, subtract penetration * inward normal unit vector.

    // inward normal unit vector is (a, b) / sqrt(a² + b²)

    // so adjustment is:

    bx -= penetration * a / Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b);

    by -= penetration * b / Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b);

    // resolve velocity

    // compute velocity component along inward normal

    v_n = (vx * a + vy * b) / Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b);

    // reverse the component

    vx -= 2 * v_n * a;

    vy -= 2 * v_n * b;

    // apply damping

    vx *= damping;

    vy *= damping;

}

This seems to be the correct approach. The ball is moved back along the inward normal direction by the penetration amount, and the velocity component along the normal is reversed, then damped.

Now, for ball-ball collisions.

For each pair of balls, check if the distance between their centers is <= 2*radius.

If so, resolve the collision.

The collision response can be approximated by swapping the velocities along the collision normal and applying damping.

The collision normal is the unit vector pointing from ball A to ball B.

So for ball A and ball B:

dx = B.x - A.x;

dy = B.y - A.y;

distance = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);

if (distance <= 2*radius) {

    // collision

    // compute normal vector

    nx = dx / distance;

    ny = dy / distance;

    // compute relative velocity

    vx_rel = A.vx - B.vx;

    vy_rel = A.vy - B.vy;

    // velocity component along normal

    v_n = vx_rel * nx + vy_rel * ny;

    // if moving apart, no collision

    if (v_n > 0) continue;

    // resolve collision

    // swap velocities along normal

    A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    B.vx += v_n * nx;

    B.vy += v_n * ny;

    // apply damping

    // reduce the relative velocity by damping factor

    // but perhaps just multiply the new velocities by damping

    // or apply friction

    // this part is tricky.

    // perhaps after collision, multiply the velocity components by damping factor.

    // but need to consider restitution.

    // For simplicity, after swapping velocities, multiply both by damping factor.

    // Or apply restitution coefficient.

    // Let's use a restitution coefficient of 0.95.

    // The velocity along the normal after collision is -restitution * v_n.

    // So:

    // new_v_n = -restitution * v_n;

    // so:

    A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    B.vx += v_n * nx;

    B.vy += v_n * ny;

    // then, apply damping to the velocities.

    // or multiply by damping factor.

    // Alternatively, after collision, the velocities are multiplied by damping factor.

    // So:

    // damping = 0.95;

    // A.vx *= damping;

    // A.vy *= damping;

    // B.vx *= damping;

    // B.vy *= damping;

    // but this might not be accurate.

    // Alternatively, apply restitution and damping.

    // The new normal velocity is -restitution * v_n.

    // So:

    // new_v_n = -restitution * v_n;

    // A.vx -= (v_n + new_v_n) * nx;

    // A.vy -= (v_n + new_v_n) * ny;

    // B.vx += (v_n + new_v_n) * nx;

    // B.vy += (v_n + new_v_n) * ny;

    // But this is more complex.

    // For simplicity, after swapping velocities, multiply by damping factor.

    // So:

    damping = 0.95;

    A.vx *= damping;

    A.vy *= damping;

    B.vx *= damping;

    B.vy *= damping;

    // but this might not be physically accurate.

    // Alternatively, apply restitution and damping.

    // Let's use restitution = 0.95.

    // The velocity after collision along normal is -restitution * v_n.

    // So:

    // A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    // A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    // B.vx += v_n * nx;

    // B.vy += v_n * ny;

    // Then apply damping to the tangential velocity.

    // The tangential velocity is the component perpendicular to the normal.

    // Compute the tangential velocity.

    vx_t = vx_rel - v_n * nx;

    vy_t = vy_rel - v_n * ny;

    // damping applied to tangential velocity.

    // but how much?

    // For simplicity, apply damping to the entire velocity.

    // Or multiply the tangential components by damping.

    // This is getting complicated.

    // Alternatively, after swapping velocities, apply damping to both balls.

    // So:

    // damping = 0.95;

    // A.vx *= damping;

    // A.vy *= damping;

    // B.vx *= damping;

    // B.vy *= damping;

    // this is simple but not accurate.

    // Alternatively, use the restitution coefficient.

    // new_v_n = -restitution * v_n;

    // so the total change in velocity is (new_v_n - v_n) * nx, ny.

    // so:

    // A.vx -= (new_v_n - v_n) * nx;

    // A.vy -= (new_v_n - v_n) * ny;

    // B.vx += (new_v_n - v_n) * nx;

    // B.vy += (new_v_n - v_n) * ny;

    // then, apply damping to the tangential velocity.

    // But this is more complex.

    // Given time constraints, perhaps just swap velocities and apply damping.

    // So:

    // swap velocities along normal.

    // A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    // A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    // B.vx += v_n * nx;

    // B.vy += v_n * ny;

    // then apply damping to both velocities.

    // damping = 0.95;

    // A.vx *= damping;

    // A.vy *= damping;

    // B.vx *= damping;

    // B.vy *= damping;

    // this might work.

    // but it's not physically accurate.

    // another approach is to use the restitution coefficient.

    // new_v_n = -restitution * v_n;

    // A.vx += (new_v_n - v_n) * nx;

    // A.vy += (new_v_n - v_n) * ny;

    // B.vx -= (new_v_n - v_n) * nx;

    // B.vy -= (new_v_n - v_n) * ny;

    // then, apply damping to the tangential velocity.

    // but this is more involved.

    // For simplicity, perhaps just swap velocities and apply damping.

    // So in code:

    // damping = 0.95;

    // A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    // A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    // B.vx += v_n * nx;

    // B.vy += v_n * ny;

    // A.vx *= damping;

    // A.vy *= damping;

    // B.vx *= damping;

    // B.vy *= damping;

    // this should reduce the velocity after collision.

    // but it's not precise.

    // however, given time constraints, this might be acceptable.

    // also, need to adjust positions to prevent overlap.

    // the penetration is the amount the balls are overlapping.

    // penetration = 2*radius - distance;

    // so the balls need to be moved apart by penetration along the normal.

    // so move A and B apart by penetration / 2 along the normal.

    // A.x -= nx * penetration / 2;

    // A.y -= ny * penetration / 2;

    // B.x += nx * penetration / 2;

    // B.y += ny * penetration / 2;

    // but this is only if the collision is detected.

    // but in the case where distance is <= 2*radius, the penetration is 2*radius - distance.

    // so:

    penetration = 2 * radius - distance;

    A.x -= nx * penetration / 2;

    A.y -= ny * penetration / 2;

    B.x += nx * penetration / 2;

    B.y += ny * penetration / 2;

    // now, resolve the collision with velocity and damping.

    // swap velocities along normal and apply damping.

    // damping = 0.9;

    // A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    // A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    // B.vx += v_n * nx;

    // B.vy += v_n * ny;

    // A.vx *= damping;

    // A.vy *= damping;

    // B.vx *= damping;

    // B.vy *= damping;

    // this should work.

    // but perhaps the damping should be applied only to the normal component.

    // for example, after collision, the normal velocity is -restitution * v_n.

    // so the total change is -restitution * v_n - v_n = v_n * ( -restitution - 1 )

    // so:

    // A.vx -= v_n * nx * (1 + restitution);

    // A.vy -= v_n * ny * (1 + restitution);

    // B.vx += v_n * nx * (1 + restitution);

    // B.vy += v_n * ny * (1 + restitution);

    // and apply damping to the tangential velocity.

    // but this is more accurate.

    // Let's try this approach.

    // restitution = 0.95;

    // damping = 0.95;

    // compute the normal change:

    delta_v = v_n * (1 + restitution);

    // apply to velocities:

    A.vx -= delta_v * nx;

    A.vy -= delta_v * ny;

    B.vx += delta_v * nx;

    B.vy += delta_v * ny;

    // compute the tangential velocity:

    vx_t = A.vx - B.vx;

    vy_t = A.vy - B.vy;

    // compute the tangential component's magnitude:

    vt = Math.sqrt(vx_t*vx_t + vy_t*vy_t);

    // apply damping to the tangential velocity:

    // vt *= damping;

    // but this is not correct because damping should be applied to each ball's tangential velocity.

    // Alternatively, after collision, the tangential velocity is multiplied by damping.

    // So for each ball, compute their tangential velocity and multiply by damping.

    // For ball A:

    vx_t_A = A.vx - (vx_t * nx + vy_t * ny) * nx;

    vy_t_A = A.vy - (vx_t * nx + vy_t * ny) * ny;

    // multiply by damping:

    vx_t_A *= damping;

    vy_t_A *= damping;

    A.vx = vx_t_A + (vx_t * nx + vy_t * ny) * nx;

    A.vy = vy_t_A + (vx_t * nx + vy_t * ny) * ny;

    // similarly for ball B.

    // this is getting too complex.

    // Given time constraints, perhaps stick to the simpler approach of swapping velocities along normal and applying damping to the entire velocity.

    // So:

    damping = 0.95;

    A.vx -= v_n * nx;

    A.vy -= v_n * ny;

    B.vx += v_n * nx;

    B.vy += v_n * ny;

    A.vx *= damping;

    A.vy *= damping;

    B.vx *= damping;

    B.vy *= damping;

    // this should work.

    // but it's not physically accurate.

    // However, for the purposes of this project, it's acceptable.

    // also, need to prevent overlap by moving the balls apart.

    // penetration = 2*radius - distance;

    // move A and B apart by penetration / 2 along the normal.

    // A.x -= nx * penetration / 2;

    // A.y -= ny * penetration / 2;

    // B.x += nx * penetration / 2;

    // B.y += ny * penetration / 2;

    // but since we already adjusted the positions earlier, maybe this is not needed.

    // wait, in the collision detection, we check if distance <= 2*radius. But if we move the balls apart, the distance becomes 2*radius, so no overlap.

    // so the code should prevent overlap.

    // but in reality, due to floating point errors, there might be some overlap.

    // so after moving the balls, perhaps add a small epsilon to prevent overlap.

    // but for now, proceed.

    // also, need to iterate over all pairs, which is O(n²).

    // but with 20 balls, 20*19/2 = 190 checks per frame, which is manageable.

    // but for optimization, spatial partitioning can be used.

    // implement a grid.

    // divide the canvas into cells.

    // for example, 10x10 grid.

    // each cell is 50x50 pixels.

    // for each ball, determine which cell it's in.

    // for collision detection, check only balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

    // this reduces the number of checks.

    // the number of cells depends on the number of balls.

    // for 20 balls, a grid of 5x5 cells might be sufficient.

    // so, implement a grid-based spatial partitioning.

    // in each frame, clear the grid and populate it with balls.

    // then, for each cell, check collisions with balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

    // this can reduce the number of checks from O(n²) to O(n * k), where k is the average number of balls per cell.

    // this is a common optimization technique.

    // let's implement this.

    // first, define the grid size.

    // for example, grid size is 5x5.

    // each cell is 100x100 pixels.

    // so, the grid cells are from (0,0) to (4,4).

    // for a ball at (x, y), the cell is (Math.floor(x / cellWidth), Math.floor(y / cellHeight)).

    // but need to consider the radius of the balls.

    // when checking collisions, a ball in cell (i,j) can collide with balls in cells (i-1,j-1) to (i+1,j+1).

    // so, for each ball, check 9 cells.

    // this is manageable.

    // code steps:

    // 1. define the grid.

    // 2. for each frame, clear the grid.

    // 3. for each ball, add it to the grid based on its position.

    // 4. for each ball, check collisions with balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

    // 5. for each pair, check collision.

    // this should reduce the number of checks.

    // let's proceed with this approach.

    // now, the code outline.

    // in the game loop:

    // clear the canvas.

    // update heptagon rotation.

    // update each ball's position (apply gravity, update velocities).

    // check wall collisions.

    // check ball-ball collisions using spatial partitioning.

    // draw the heptagon and balls.

    // so, the grid code.

    // define grid size: maybe 5x5.

    // cell width and height: canvas width / grid size.

    // for example, gridSize = 5, cellWidth = canvas.width / gridSize.

    // but if the heptagon is smaller than the canvas, maybe use a grid based on the heptagon's size.

    // heptagon radius is 200, so the grid should cover the heptagon.

    // but the balls can be outside the heptagon, so the grid needs to cover the entire canvas.

    // perhaps use the canvas size.

    // gridSizeX = 5, gridSizeY = 5.

    // cellWidth = canvas.width / gridSizeX, cellHeight = canvas.height / gridSizeY.

    // for each ball, determine the cell it's in.

    // cellX = Math.floor(ball.x / cellWidth);

    // cellY = Math.floor(ball.y / cellHeight);

    // but need to handle edge cases.

    // create a 2D array grid where each cell is an array of balls.

    // then, for each ball, check collisions with balls in cells from (cellX-1, cellY-1) to (cellX+1, cellY+1).

    // so, for each ball, iterate through 9 cells.

    // but this requires checking if the cell indices are within bounds.

    // code:

    // create grid:

    // grid = [];

    // for (let i = 0; i < gridSizeX; i++) {

    //     grid[i] = [];

    //     for (let j = 0; j < gridSizeY; j++) {

    //         grid[i][j] = [];

    //     }

    // }

    // for each ball:

    // cellX = Math.floor(ball.x / cellWidth);

    // cellY = Math.floor(ball.y / cellHeight);

    // add ball to grid[cellX][cellY].

    // then, for collision detection:

    // for each ball in grid:

    //     cellX = Math.floor(ball.x / cellWidth);

    //     cellY = Math.floor(ball.y / cellHeight);

    //     for (let i = cellX
