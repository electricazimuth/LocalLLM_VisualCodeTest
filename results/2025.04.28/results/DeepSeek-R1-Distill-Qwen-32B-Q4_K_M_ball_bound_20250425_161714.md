Okay, I need to create a bouncing balls simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to have a canvas with multiple balls bouncing around, interacting with each other and the walls. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach each part.

First, the HTML setup is given, so I'll start with that. The canvas is already set up with an id of 'gameCanvas' and a size of 800x600. The script section is where I'll add my code.

For the balls, I'll represent each as an object with properties like position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), radius (r), mass, and color. Since mass can be proportional to the radius squared, I'll calculate it as r * r.

Initialization is next. I need to create at least 30 balls. I'll loop through creating each ball, assigning random positions within the canvas, random velocities, and random colors. To prevent initial overlaps, I'll check each new ball against existing ones, but it's noted that perfect non-overlap isn't necessary, so I can allow some initial overlaps as long as they resolve quickly.

The animation loop will use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates. Each frame, I'll clear the canvas, update each ball's physics, handle collisions, and then redraw them.

Physics updates include applying gravity. I'll add a constant gravitational acceleration to each ball's vy. Then, update their positions based on velocity.

Wall collision detection involves checking each ball's position against the canvas boundaries, considering their radius. If a collision is detected, I'll reverse the velocity component and apply damping by multiplying it by a damping factor (like 0.8). Also, correct the position to ensure the ball is inside the boundary.

For ball-to-ball collisions, I need to check each pair. The naive approach is O(n^2), which can be slow for 50+ balls. To optimize, I'll implement spatial partitioning using a grid. Each cell will hold references to balls whose bounding boxes intersect the cell. This way, I only check pairs within the same cell or adjacent cells, reducing the number of checks.

The collision response between balls should prevent sticking and overlap. I'll calculate the collision vector, determine the overlap, and adjust velocities based on their masses and the collision angle. Using the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy, I'll compute the new velocities after collision.

Drawing each ball is straightforward with ctx.arc, filling the circle with the ball's color.

I'll also consider performance optimizations, like using a grid for spatial partitioning, to handle the O(n^2) problem. This should allow the simulation to run smoothly with 50+ balls.

Testing each part step by step is crucial. I'll start by ensuring balls move and bounce off walls correctly. Then, add ball-to-ball collisions, checking for overlaps and ensuring they bounce off each other without sticking. Finally, I'll implement the grid optimization to see if it improves performance.

Potential issues to watch out for include floating-point precision errors when checking for collisions and ensuring that the grid correctly partitions the balls. Also, making sure that the collision response doesn't cause unexpected behavior, like balls passing through each other or getting stuck.

I'll structure the code with clear functions for initialization, updating physics, handling collisions, and drawing. Using classes or objects for balls will make the code organized and readable.

In the end, I'll ensure that all required features are implemented: gravity, wall collisions with damping, ball-to-ball collisions with response, and efficient rendering using the canvas API. The code should be clean, well-commented, and optimized for performance.
