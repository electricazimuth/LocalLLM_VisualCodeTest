Okay, I need to create an aquarium simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to have multiple fish swimming around in a canvas, each with their own movement and behavior. Let me break down the requirements and figure out how to approach this.

First, I'll start by setting up the HTML structure. The user provided a boilerplate, but I notice there are two canvas elements with different IDs. I should correct that to have only one canvas with the correct ID, probably "simulationCanvas" as per the initial setup.

Next, the CSS. The body should have no margin and hidden overflow to prevent scrollbars. The canvas should be centered with a border and a light blue background to simulate water. I'll adjust the canvas dimensions to 800x600 for a more standard look.

Now, onto the JavaScript. I'll need to create a Fish class to encapsulate each fish's properties and behaviors. Each fish should have position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), size, color, and direction. The constructor will randomize these properties within certain ranges to create variety among the fish.

For movement, each fish will update its position based on velocity. I'll implement boundary detection so that when a fish hits the edge, it bounces off. To make the movement more natural, I'll add a wandering behavior where each fish slowly changes direction over time. This will prevent them from moving in straight lines indefinitely.

The animation loop will use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates. In each frame, I'll clear the canvas, update each fish's state, and then redraw them. Using delta time will ensure the movement is frame-rate independent, making the simulation consistent across different browsers.

Drawing the fish involves creating a simple shape. I'll use a combination of arcs and lines to form a basic fish outline. The fish will be oriented based on their direction using rotation in the canvas context.

I'll initialize an array of fish objects, say 20 of them, each with random properties. Then, in the game loop, I'll handle the update and draw phases for each fish.

Testing is important. I'll make sure that all fish stay within the canvas, move smoothly, and change direction naturally. I'll also check that the simulation runs efficiently without performance issues.

Finally, I'll add some notes in the HTML comments to explain the implementation details, such as the Fish class structure, movement mechanics, and drawing techniques. This will help anyone reviewing the code understand the approach taken.

Here's a complete implementation of the Autonomous Aquarium Simulation:

This implementation includes:

1. A `Fish` class that encapsulates all fish properties and behaviors:
   - Random initialization of position, velocity, size, and color
   - Autonomous movement with direction changes
   - Boundary detection and reflection
   - Simple fish shape with orientation based on movement direction

2. Efficient animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` with deltaTime calculations for smooth, frame-rate independent movement.

3. Visual features:
   - Fish are drawn with a simple shape that includes a body and tail
   - Fish orientation follows their movement direction
   - Random colors using HSL color space for variety
   - Collision with boundaries that causes reflection

4. Performance considerations:
   - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation
   - Efficient array-based management of fish objects
   - Simple physics calculations for movement and boundary detection

The simulation creates a calming effect with multiple fish swimming naturally within the boundaries of the canvas. Each fish has its own path and behavior, creating an engaging visual experience.

You can adjust parameters like `maxFish` (number of fish), fish size range, speed, and color saturation to modify the appearance and behavior of the simulation.
