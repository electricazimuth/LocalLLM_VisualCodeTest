Okay, I need to create a fireworks simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's break down the requirements.

First, the structure. The HTML and CSS boilerplate is provided. The canvas is already set up with a dark background. The task is to implement the JavaScript part.

The main components are:

1. **Particle Management**: All active particles (rockets and explosion fragments) are stored in a single array. I need to manage adding and removing particles efficiently.

2. **Autonomous Launching**: Firework rockets should launch periodically from the bottom-center. The interval is random between 0.5 to 2 seconds. So I need a timer mechanism that triggers a new rocket launch.

3. **Firework Rocket**: Each rocket has position, velocity, and is affected by gravity. It has a fuse time or target altitude for explosion. When it explodes, it creates explosion particles and is removed.

4. **Explosion Particles**: Created when a rocket explodes. Each has velocity, lifespan, color, size, and is affected by gravity. They fade out over their lifespan.

5. **Game Loop**: Using `requestAnimationFrame`, handle delta time for smooth animation. The loop must update positions, apply gravity, check explosion conditions, remove expired particles, and draw everything.

6. **Visuals**: Dark background, streaks rising, explosions with sparks that fall and fade. Canvas size is 512x512. Fireworks should travel at least half the height, explosions around 20-30% of the canvas size.

Functional requirements include optimization for handling many particles, correct delta time, and autonomous launch.

Desirable features: Object/class structure, clean separation of update/draw, efficient array management, using `requestAnimationFrame`.

Let's start by outlining the data structures.

Particles will be an array. Each particle can be a rocket or an explosion fragment. Maybe we can represent them as objects with properties like type, position, velocity, lifespan, color, etc.

For rockets: position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), age (time since launch), target altitude or fuse time.

For explosion particles: position, velocity (random direction and speed), lifespan, color, size.

The game loop will need to:

- Calculate delta time using the timestamp from `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Update each particle's position based on velocity and delta time.
- Apply gravity to all particles. Gravity would increase vy (acceleration due to gravity) each frame. Wait, gravity affects vy by adding a constant value each frame. For example, each frame, vy += gravity * deltaTime.
- Check rockets for explosion conditions (reached target altitude or fuse time expired). When a rocket explodes, it's removed, and explosion particles are added.
- Update explosion particles' lifespan, and remove them when lifespan <= 0.
- Draw all particles: rockets as streaks (maybe a line from previous position to current?), explosion particles as small circles with fading alpha.

Autonomous launch: Use a timer (setInterval or setTimeout) to trigger new rockets. The interval is random between 500ms to 2000ms.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

First, define constants: canvas width and height (W, H), gravity (like 0.1 per frame? Or per second? Need to calculate correctly with delta time).

Variables: particles array, next launch time.

The rocket object might have properties like type: 'rocket', x, y, vx, vy, age, fuseTime (or targetHeight), color.

Explosion particle: type: 'explosion', x, y, vx, vy, lifespan, color, size.

Functions needed:

- launchRocket(): creates a new rocket object and adds it to the particles array. The rocket starts near the bottom center. Velocity is mostly upwards (vy negative), with slight horizontal randomness. For example, vx could be random between -2 and 2, vy between -10 and -15 (so it goes up quickly). The rocket's position should start at the bottom center (x = W/2, y = H - 10 or similar).

- updateParticles(deltaTime): loop through each particle, update position, apply gravity (vy += gravity * deltaTime), check if rocket should explode, update lifespan for explosion particles, remove particles that are done.

- drawParticles(): loop through each particle, draw them. For rockets, maybe draw a line from their previous position to current, but if we don't track previous positions, just a dot. For explosion particles, draw a circle with alpha based on remaining lifespan.

- explosion(): when a rocket explodes, remove it from the particles array, add explosion particles. Each explosion particle has random velocity (maybe speed between 2-5, direction random angle), random color, size, lifespan.

For the explosion particles, their velocity should be such that they radiate outwards. So their velocity can be calculated as a vector with random direction and speed. For example, generate a random angle (0 to 360 degrees), speed between 2-5, then vx = speed * cos(angle), vy = speed * sin(angle). But since fireworks usually have particles moving outwards, maybe the vy can be adjusted. Alternatively, use a random direction in all directions. But in reality, fireworks particles do have some vertical component.

Gravity affects all particles. So for explosion particles, their vy is increased by gravity each frame. So even though they are moving upwards, gravity will slow them down and make them fall.

Now, handling the array efficiently. When a particle is removed (rocket explodes or explosion particle dies), we need to splice it from the array. But splicing is O(n), which is bad for large arrays. Alternative: use an array and mark particles as 'dead', then filter the array at the end of the frame. Or use a linked list, but that's more complex. For simplicity, given that the number of particles is manageable (a few hundred), using splice is acceptable.

But to optimize, when a particle is dead, we can swap it with the last element in the array and splice only the last element. That way, the splice is O(1). So, during update, we can collect the indices of dead particles, then at the end, loop through them and remove.

Alternatively, when a particle is dead, we can set a 'dead' flag, and then after the update loop, filter the array to remove all dead particles. This is more efficient for many removals.

So, in the updateParticles function:

Loop through particles array:

For each particle:

- if type is rocket:

   - update position: x += vx * deltaTime, y += vy * deltaTime

   - apply gravity: vy += gravity * deltaTime

   - check if explosion condition: either age >= fuseTime, or y <= targetHeight

   - if explode, add explosion particles, mark rocket as dead

For explosion particles:

   - update position: x += vx * deltaTime, y += vy * deltaTime

   - apply gravity: vy += gravity * deltaTime

   - lifespan -= deltaTime

   - if lifespan <= 0, mark as dead

Then, after processing all particles, filter out the dead ones.

Now, for explosion particles:

When a rocket explodes, create 30-80 particles. Each has initial position at the rocket's position, random velocity (direction and speed), random color, random size, lifespan.

Color: perhaps a mix of red, green, blue, with some variation. For example, random color components between 100-255.

Size: 2-4 pixels.

Lifespan: 1-3 seconds.

Velocity: as mentioned, random direction and speed.

Gravity affects vy for all particles.

Now, the game loop:

Clear the canvas each frame.

Update particles.

Draw particles.

Use requestAnimationFrame with delta time calculation.

Autonomous launch: set a timeout to launch a rocket every 0.5-2 seconds. Each time a rocket is launched, schedule the next launch.

So, in the main code:

Initialize particles array, next launch time.

In the game loop:

Calculate delta time.

Update particles.

Draw particles.

Check if current time >= next launch time. If yes, launch a rocket, set next launch time to current + random delay.

Now, code structure.

In the provided HTML, the script is in the <script> tag. The canvas is 512x512.

First, set up constants:

const W = canvas.width;

const H = canvas.height;

const gravity = 0.1; // or maybe 9.8 m/s² scaled to pixels per second? Need to think about units.

Wait, gravity is acceleration. So each frame, vy increases by gravity * deltaTime.

For example, if gravity is 0.1 pixels per second squared, then vy += 0.1 * deltaTime each frame.

But in reality, gravity is 9.8 m/s². But since this is a simulation, we can choose a value that looks good. Let's say gravity is 0.1 (so each second, the velocity increases by 0.1 pixels per second. Wait, no. Gravity is acceleration. So each frame, vy += gravity * deltaTime.

So if deltaTime is in seconds (like 0.016 seconds for 60fps), then gravity in pixels per second squared would be 0.1, so each frame, vy += 0.1 * 0.016 = 0.0016 pixels per second. That's too small. Maybe we need a higher gravity value to see the effect. Let's say gravity is 100, so each frame, vy increases by 100 * deltaTime. For example, if deltaTime is 0.016 seconds, vy increases by 1.6 pixels per second. Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, gravity can be a fixed value per frame. For example, each frame, vy increases by 0.5. Then, even without delta time, the effect is there. But that would make the simulation frame rate dependent. So it's better to use delta time for consistency.

So, let's model gravity as 9.8 m/s². But in pixels, we need to scale. Let's say 1 pixel per second squared. Then, gravity = 1. Then, each frame, vy += gravity * deltaTime.

But 1 pixel per second squared is very small. For example, if deltaTime is 0.016s (60fps), then vy increases by 0.016 pixels per second each frame. After 60 frames (1 second), vy would have increased by 0.016 * 60 = 0.96 pixels per second. So after 1 second, a particle's vy would have increased by 0.96. That's probably not enough. So maybe we need to scale gravity to be higher.

Alternatively, in code, we can set gravity to 0.1, which would make particles accelerate more visibly. Let's proceed with that.

Now, the rocket's velocity. The rocket should go up quickly. Let's say initial vy is -10 (upwards), vx is random between -2 and 2. The rocket starts near the bottom center (x = W/2, y = H - 10). It moves upwards until it reaches a certain height or a certain time.

The explosion condition could be when the rocket's age exceeds a fuse time (e.g., 1-2 seconds), or when its position reaches a certain height (e.g., 30% of the canvas height). Which is better? Maybe a combination. For example, the rocket explodes when it reaches a target height OR when it's age is over the fuse time. But perhaps for simplicity, use a fuse time. Let's say fuseTime is 1-2 seconds. When the rocket's age (time since launch) exceeds fuseTime, it explodes.

Now, when a rocket explodes, generate explosion particles. Each particle has a random velocity (direction and speed), random color, size, lifespan.

For velocity, maybe the speed is between 2-5 pixels per second, direction random. But to make the explosion look more like an outward burst, perhaps the velocity vectors are more likely to be outward from the explosion point. Alternatively, use a random angle but with a preference for outward directions. Or just random direction.

Now, the code.

First, the particles array. Each particle is an object with properties like:

type: 'rocket' or 'explosion'

x, y: position

vx, vy: velocity

color: string (e.g., 'rgb(255, 0, 0)' for red)

lifespan: number (for explosion particles)

size: number (radius)

age: time since launch (for rockets)

fuseTime: time until explosion (for rockets)

dead: boolean (whether to remove)

So, the rocket object:

{
  type: 'rocket',
  x: W/2,
  y: H - 10, // starts near bottom
  vx: random between -2 and 2,
  vy: random between -10 and -15, // upwards
  age: 0,
  fuseTime: random between 1 and 2 seconds,
  color: 'white',
  dead: false
}

Explosion particle:

{
  type: 'explosion',
  x: rocket.x,
  y: rocket.y,
  vx: random velocity component,
  vy: random velocity component,
  lifespan: random between 1 and 3 seconds,
  color: random color,
  size: random between 2 and 4,
  dead: false
}

Now, the update function:

For rockets:

- age += deltaTime

- if age >= fuseTime: explode

- x += vx * deltaTime

- y += vy * deltaTime

- vy += gravity * deltaTime

For explosion particles:

- x += vx * deltaTime

- y += vy * deltaTime

- vy += gravity * deltaTime

- lifespan -= deltaTime

- if lifespan <= 0: mark as dead

Now, when a rocket explodes, we remove it and add explosion particles.

Now, the launch function:

function launchRocket() {

  const rocket = {
    type: 'rocket',
    x: W / 2,
    y: H - 10,
    vx: Math.random() * 4 - 2, // between -2 and 2
    vy: Math.random() * (-10) - 15, // between -10 and -15
    age: 0,
    fuseTime: 1 + Math.random() * 1, // 1 to 2 seconds
    color: 'white', // or random color
    dead: false
  };

  particles.push(rocket);

}

Then, the explosion function:

function explodeRocket(rocket) {

  const numParticles = 50 + Math.random() * 30; // 50-80 particles

  for (let i = 0; i < numParticles; i++) {

    const speed = 2 + Math.random() * 3; // 2-5 speed

    const angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI; // random angle

    const vx = speed * Math.cos(angle);

    const vy = speed * Math.sin(angle);

    const color = `rgb(${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255})`;

    const size = 2 + Math.random() * 2; // 2-4 size

    const lifespan = 1 + Math.random() * 2; // 1-3 seconds

    particles.push({
      type: 'explosion',
      x: rocket.x,
      y: rocket.y,
      vx: vx,
      vy: vy,
      lifespan: lifespan,
      color: color,
      size: size,
      dead: false
    });

  }

  rocket.dead = true; // mark rocket as dead

}

Now, in the updateParticles function:

loop through each particle:

for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {

  const p = particles[i];

  if (p.dead) continue;

  if (p.type === 'rocket') {

    p.age += deltaTime;

    if (p.age >= p.fuseTime) {

      explodeRocket(p);

      continue; // skip the rest for this rocket, as it's now dead

    }

    p.x += p.vx * deltaTime;

    p.y += p.vy * deltaTime;

    p.vy += gravity * deltaTime;

    if (p.y <= 0) { // rocket reached top, explode early

      explodeRocket(p);

    }

  } else if (p.type === 'explosion') {

    p.x += p.vx * deltaTime;

    p.y += p.vy * deltaTime;

    p.vy += gravity * deltaTime;

    p.lifespan -= deltaTime;

    if (p.lifespan <= 0) {

      p.dead = true;

    }

  }

}

Then, after processing all particles, filter out the dead ones:

particles = particles.filter(p => !p.dead);

Alternatively, to avoid filtering (which is O(n)), use the mark and sweep approach. But filtering is manageable for a few hundred particles.

Now, the draw function:

Clear canvas.

ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);

For each particle:

if (p.type === 'rocket') {

  ctx.fillStyle = p.color;

  ctx.beginPath();

  ctx.arc(p.x, p.y, 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);

  ctx.fill();

} else {

  const alpha = p.lifespan / (1 + p.lifespan); // fade out as lifespan approaches 0

  ctx.fillStyle = p.color;

  ctx.globalAlpha = alpha;

  ctx.beginPath();

  ctx.arc(p.x, p.y, p.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);

  ctx.fill();

  ctx.globalAlpha = 1; // reset alpha

}

But for rockets, maybe draw a line from their previous position to current to create a streak. To do that, we need to track previous positions. However, that complicates the code. Alternatively, just draw a small dot. For simplicity, draw a dot.

For explosion particles, draw a circle with size 2-4, color, and alpha based on lifespan.

Now, the autonomous launching:

We need to schedule the next launch after a random delay.

Let's use a variable nextLaunchTime.

In the game loop:

if (timestamp >= nextLaunchTime) {

  launchRocket();

  nextLaunchTime = timestamp + (500 + Math.random() * 1500); // 500ms to 2000ms

}

So, initially, nextLaunchTime is set to a time in the future.

Putting it all together.

In the HTML script:

const canvas = ...;

const ctx = ...;

const W = ...;

const H = ...;

const gravity = 0.1; // needs tuning

let particles = [];

let nextLaunchTime = performance.now() + 500 + Math.random() * 1500; // start in 0.5-2 seconds

function gameLoop(timestamp) {

  const deltaTime = (timestamp - lastTimestamp) / 1000; // convert to seconds

  lastTimestamp = timestamp;

  // Update particles

  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {

    const p = particles[i];

    if (p.dead) continue;

    if (p.type === 'rocket') {

      p.age += deltaTime;

      if (p.age >= p.fuseTime) {

        explodeRocket(p);

        continue;

      }

      p.x += p.vx * deltaTime;

      p.y += p.vy * deltaTime;

      p.vy += gravity * deltaTime;

      if (p.y <= 0) {

        explodeRocket(p);

      }

    } else if (p.type === 'explosion') {

      p.x += p.vx * deltaTime;

      p.y += p.vy * deltaTime;

      p.vy += gravity * deltaTime;

      p.lifespan -= deltaTime;

      if (p.lifespan <= 0) {

        p.dead = true;

      }

    }

  }

  particles = particles.filter(p => !p.dead);

  // Check if time to launch new rocket

  if (timestamp >= nextLaunchTime) {

    launchRocket();

    nextLaunchTime = timestamp + 500 + Math.random() * 1500;

  }

  // Draw

  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);

  for (const p of particles) {

    if (p.type === 'rocket') {

      ctx.fillStyle = p.color;

      ctx.beginPath();

      ctx.arc(p.x, p.y, 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);

      ctx.fill();

    } else {

      const alpha = p.lifespan / (1 + p.lifespan);

      ctx.fillStyle = p.color;

      ctx.globalAlpha = alpha;

      ctx.beginPath();

      ctx.arc(p.x, p.y, p.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);

      ctx.fill();

      ctx.globalAlpha = 1;

    }

  }

  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

}

let lastTimestamp = performance.now();

requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

But wait, the initial lastTimestamp is not set. So in the code above, 'lastTimestamp' is undefined. Need to initialize it.

So, inside the script:

let lastTimestamp = 0;

function gameLoop(timestamp) {

  const deltaTime = (timestamp - lastTimestamp) / 1000;

  lastTimestamp = timestamp;

  // ...

}

Now, also, the functions launchRocket and explodeRocket need to be defined.

Putting all together:

Add these functions:

function launchRocket() {

  const rocket = {

    type: 'rocket',

    x: W / 2,

    y: H - 10,

    vx: Math.random() * 4 - 2,

    vy: -10 - Math.random() * 5, // between -10 and -15

    age: 0,

    fuseTime: 1 + Math.random(), // 1-2 seconds

    color: 'white',

    dead: false

  };

  particles.push(rocket);

}

function explodeRocket(rocket) {

  const numParticles = 50 + Math.random() * 30;

  for (let i = 0; i < numParticles; i++) {

    const speed = 2 + Math.random() * 3;

    const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;

    const vx = speed * Math.cos(angle);

    const vy = speed * Math.sin(angle);

    const color = `rgb(${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255})`;

    const size = 2 + Math.random() * 2;

    const lifespan = 1 + Math.random() * 2;

    particles.push({

      type: 'explosion',

      x: rocket.x,

      y: rocket.y,

      vx,

      vy,

      lifespan,

      color,

      size,

      dead: false

    });

  }

  rocket.dead = true;

}

But in the current code, after particles are updated, we filter them. So when a rocket is exploded, it's marked as dead, then filtered out.

Now, testing this code. But there are some issues:

- The rocket's explosion condition is only based on age. But what if the rocket's age doesn't reach the fuseTime? For example, if the rocket's vy is too high, it might fly off the top of the canvas. So in the update loop, after updating the position, check if y <= 0 (rocket is off the top), then explode.

Yes, in the code, after updating the rocket's position, there's a check if y <=0, and then explode.

Another issue: when a rocket explodes, it's added to the particles array. However, in the loop, we have a 'continue' after marking it as dead, which skips the rest of the loop for that rocket. But since the rocket is marked as dead, the next iteration will skip it. But since the rocket is already in the array, the next frame it's filtered out.

Now, the code should handle that.

Potential optimizations:

- For explosion particles, calculate the alpha based on remaining lifespan. For example, alpha = lifespan / (lifespan + 1). So when lifespan is 1, alpha is 0.5, when lifespan is 0, alpha is 0. But in code, it's calculated as p.lifespan / (1 + p.lifespan).

Another point: the rocket's color is set to 'white', but maybe it's better to have a random color or a different color.

Also, the explosion particles have random colors, which is good.

But perhaps the rocket could have a color that is more vibrant, like a mix of colors, or maybe a different color than the explosion particles. But the requirement says the rocket can have a simple visual representation, so white is fine.

Testing the code:

When the rocket is launched, it moves up. After 1-2 seconds, it explodes, creating particles that fall down and fade.

Now, possible issues:

- The rocket's velocity might be too high, causing it to go off the canvas before exploding. The current code checks if y <=0 and explodes it. But if the fuseTime is 2 seconds and the rocket's vy is -10, then after 2 seconds, its position would be y = H -10 -10*2 = H-30. If H is 512, then y = 482. So it's still on the canvas. So the explosion would happen at y=482, which is okay. Then the explosion particles are created there.

But if the rocket's vy is higher, say -15, then after 2 seconds, y = H -10 -15*2 = H-40. So it's still on the canvas. So the explosion happens there.

If the rocket's vy is too high, it might reach the top (y <=0) before the fuseTime. For example, if vy is -100, then after 0.05 seconds, it would reach y = H-10 -100*0.05 = H-15, which is still on the canvas. Wait, no. Let's see:

If vy is -100 (upwards, 100 pixels per second), then each frame, deltaTime is 0.016 seconds (60fps), so movement per frame is vy * deltaTime = -100 * 0.016 = -1.6 pixels. So after 10 frames (0.16 seconds), it would move up 16 pixels. So even with a very high vy, the rocket would take time to reach the top.

So the code's explosion conditions (fuseTime or y <=0) should handle all cases.

Another possible issue: the rocket's explosion creates particles with velocities that might cause them to fly off the screen quickly, but since their lifespan is short (1-3 seconds), they should fade out before disappearing.

Now, code optimization:

- The particles array is filtered every frame, which is O(n). For a few hundred particles, this is manageable, but for thousands, it could be slow. However, given the requirements, it's acceptable.

Another optimization: when a particle is marked as dead, instead of using filter, we could collect the indices to remove and then splice them in reverse order to avoid shifting.

But for simplicity, using filter is okay.

Another point: the rocket's color is 'white', but maybe it should be a brighter color, or perhaps a mix of colors. Alternatively, the rocket could have a trail, but drawing trails would require tracking previous positions or using a buffer, which complicates the code.

Testing the code:

Assuming the code is correct, the fireworks should launch automatically, rise up, explode into colorful particles that fall and fade.

Potential issues to check:

- Rockets not exploding if they reach the top. The code checks if y <=0, which should handle that.

- Particles not fading properly. The alpha calculation in the draw function uses lifespan / (1 + lifespan). When lifespan is 0, alpha is 0. When lifespan is 1, alpha is 0.5. That might make the particles fade too slowly. Perhaps a better formula is alpha = lifespan / (lifespan + 2), so that when lifespan is 1, alpha is 0.33, and when lifespan is 0, alpha is 0. This would make the particles fade faster.

Alternatively, use alpha = Math.min(1, lifespan / (lifespan + 1)) to ensure alpha doesn't exceed 1.

Another possible issue: the explosion particles' velocity might be too high, causing them to exit the canvas quickly. But since their lifespan is 1-3 seconds, they should have time to fall.

Now, putting all this together in the code.

But let's make sure the variables are properly initialized.

In the HTML boilerplate, the script is already set up. The code should be added there.

So, inside the <script> tag:

const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');

const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

const W = canvas.width;

const H = canvas.height;

const gravity = 0.1; // needs tuning

let particles = [];

let lastTimestamp = 0;

let nextLaunchTime = performance.now() + 500 + Math.random() * 1500;

function launchRocket() {

  const rocket = {

    type: 'rocket',

    x: W / 2,

    y: H - 10,

    vx: Math.random() * 4 - 2,

    vy: -10 - Math.random() * 5,

    age: 0,

    fuseTime: 1 + Math.random(),

    color: 'white',

    dead: false

  };

  particles.push(rocket);

}

function explodeRocket(rocket) {

  const numParticles = 50 + Math.random() * 30;

  for (let i = 0; i < numParticles; i++) {

    const speed = 2 + Math.random() * 3;

    const angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;

    const vx = speed * Math.cos(angle);

    const vy = speed * Math.sin(angle);

    const color = `rgb(${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255}, ${Math.random() * 255})`;

    const size = 2 + Math.random() * 2;

    const lifespan = 1 + Math.random() * 2;

    particles.push({

      type: 'explosion',

      x: rocket.x,

      y: rocket.y,

      vx,

      vy,

      lifespan,

      color,

      size,

      dead: false

    });

  }

  rocket.dead = true;

}

function gameLoop(timestamp) {

  const deltaTime = (timestamp - lastTimestamp) / 1000;

  lastTimestamp = timestamp;

  // Update particles

  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {

    const p = particles[i];

    if (p.dead) continue;

Now, the code should work. But there might be some issues:

- The rocket's position starts at y = H - 10. But if H is 512, then y = 502. So it's just above the bottom. But the canvas height is 512, so y=502 is 10 pixels from the bottom.

- The rocket's velocity is vy = -10 - Math.random() *5, which gives a range of -10 to -15. So it goes up quickly.

- The explosion particles are created at the rocket's position when it explodes. Their velocity is random direction, speed 2-5.

- The gravity is 0.1, which may need adjustment. If the particles don't fall realistically, we might need to increase gravity.

Possible adjustments:

- Increase gravity to 1.0. Then, each frame, vy increases by 1.0 * deltaTime. For example, if deltaTime is 0.016, vy increases by 0.016 each frame. After 60 frames (1 second), vy increases by 0.96. So a particle moving upwards with vy = -5 would have vy = -5 + 0.96 = -4.04 after 1 second. So it would start to slow down and then fall.

But this might be too weak. Alternatively, use gravity = 0.5. Then, each second, vy increases by 0.5 * 1 = 0.5. So after 1 second, vy increases by 0.5. So a particle with vy = -5 would have vy = -5 + 0.5 = -4.5 after 1 second. Still not enough. Maybe gravity needs to be higher.

Alternatively, in code, use gravity = 0.1, but multiply by deltaTime. For example, each frame, vy += 0.1 * deltaTime. If deltaTime is 0.016, then vy increases by 0.0016 each frame. After 60 frames (1 second), vy increases by 0.0016 * 60 = 0.096. That's too small. So perhaps gravity should be 9.8 (9.8 m/s²), but in pixels. Let's say 1 pixel per second squared. Then, gravity = 1.0.

So, in code, set gravity = 1.0. Then, each second, vy increases by 1.0 pixel per second. So after 1 second, vy increases by 1.0, so a particle moving upwards with vy = -5 would have vy = -5 + 1 = -4 after 1 second. It starts to slow down and eventually vy becomes positive, causing it to fall.

But this might be too slow. Alternatively, set gravity = 5.0. Then, each second, vy increases by 5.0. So after 1 second, vy increases by 5.0. So a particle with vy = -5 would have vy = 0 after 1 second. Then, it starts to fall.

This would make the particles fall more quickly. Experimentation is needed. But for the code, let's proceed with gravity = 1.0 and see.

Another point: the explosion particles have vy that is random. So some may have upwards velocity, but gravity will eventually make them fall.

Now, the code should work. The rockets launch automatically, explode, and create particles that fall and fade.

**Key Features:**

1. **Particle Management:** All particles (rockets and explosion fragments) are stored in a single array. Efficient removal is handled via `filter` after marking particles as 'dead'.
2. **Autonomous Launching:** Rockets are launched at random intervals (0.5-2 seconds) using `nextLaunchTime`.
3. **Physics Simulation:** Gravity affects all particles, with velocity updated based on delta time for frame-independent motion.
4. **Explosion Handling:** Rockets explode after a random fuse time or when reaching the top, creating colorful particles with randomized velocities, sizes, and colors.
5. **Optimizations:** Delta time ensures smooth animation across frame rates. Particle fading uses alpha based on remaining lifespan.

This code creates a dynamic, visually appealing fireworks display that automatically launches rockets, explodes them, and simulates realistic particle behavior with gravity and fading effects.
