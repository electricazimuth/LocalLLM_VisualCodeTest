<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce full solution: single HTML file with JavaScript, vertex shader, fragment shader. Must do raymarching with smooth minimum for multiple metaballs. Provide animation. Should be self-contained. Use WebGL2 maybe? But we can use WebGL1 with GLSL ES 1.0. But we can also use WebGL2 for better features but not necessary. Implementation: full-screen quad. Provide time uniform. Provide resolution uniform. Provide metaballs positions and radii as uniform arrays; but we can compute positions in shader using time, e.g., using sin/cos.

Simplify: use 4 metaballs or 8. Use sphere SDF: `sdSphere(p, r) = length(p) - r`.

Smooth min: we can use `smin(a,b,k) = -log(exp(-k*a)+exp(-k*b))/k;` but log/exponential may be heavy; but still fine. Or use `smin = mix(a,b, smoothstep(k - a, k + a, b))`? Let's implement the log version for clarity.

Combine: `float d = sdSphere(p - pos[0], r[0]); for i>0 d = smin(d, sdSphere(p - pos[i], r[i]), k);` where k is smoothing factor.

We can compute positions as function of time: e.g., `pos[i] = vec3(sin(t+offset), cos(t+offset), sin(t*0.5+offset)*0.5);` etc. Radii maybe vary with time: `r[i] = 0.3 + 0.1*sin(t + offset)`.

We need to compute normal: gradient via sampling SDF at small epsilon: `vec3 normal = normalize(vec3(d(p+eps.xyy), d(p+eps.yxy), d(p+eps.yyx)) - ... )` Actually typical: `vec3 e = vec3(0.001, 0.0, 0.0);` Then `float dx = d(p+e.xyy) - d(p-e.xyy);` etc. But we can compute by central difference: `vec3 normal = normalize(vec3(d(p+vec3(e,0,0))-d(p-vec3(e,0,0)), ...))`. Use small epsilon like 0.001.

Lighting: simple directional light: `vec3 lightDir = normalize(vec3(0.5, 0.8, 0.3));` Compute diffuse: `diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);`. Use color: e.g., base color from position or from metaball id; we can compute color = hsv2rgb(mod((p.x + p.y + p.z + t),1.0), 0.8, 1.0). Or we can use a function to convert HSL to RGB.

Alternatively, compute color using `sin` of coordinates: `vec3 col = 0.5 + 0.5*cos(6.28318*(vec3(1.0, 1.7, 2.0)*p + t));` This gives swirling color.

We also can add glow: apply `pow(diff, 5.0)` for specular.

But we want psychedelic: maybe use `vec3 col = hsv2rgb(vec3(0.5 + 0.5*sin(t+length(p)*3.0), 0.8, 0.9));` But we want color to change as function of time and distance. Use `col = hsv2rgb(vec3((p.x + p.y + p.z + t)/6.28318, 0.7, 0.9));`.

We can also incorporate noise: but we can skip.

Implementation details: Setup full-screen quad: positions: [-1,-1], [1,-1], [1,1], [-1,1]. Vertex shader passes through to clip space.

Uniforms: `uniform float iTime; uniform vec2 iResolution;`. Add `uniform int iNumBalls;` maybe not needed.

In fragment shader, compute ray: camera origin at (0,0,-3). Look at origin. Use camera basis: `vec3 forward = normalize(vec3(0.0,0.0,1.0));` Actually we want to look at the origin. We'll use perspective: `vec2 uv = (gl_FragCoord.xy / iResolution.xy)*2.0 - 1.0;` Then adjust for aspect: `uv.x *= iResolution.x / iResolution.y;`. Then compute ray direction: `vec3 rayDir = normalize(vec3(uv.x, uv.y, 1.0));` But we want to look into z positive direction; so camera at origin and ray into +z? Actually we want to view a scene in front of camera. We can set camera at (0,0,-4) and look at origin. So `vec3 camPos = vec3(0.0,0.0,-4.0);` `vec3 rayDir = normalize(vec3(uv.x, uv.y, 1.0));` That will produce rays pointing into +z.

Raymarch loop: `float t = 0.0; const int MAX_STEPS = 100; const float MAX_DIST = 100.0; const float SURF_DIST = 0.001;` For each step compute `float dist = map(p);` where `p = camPos + t*rayDir;`. If dist < SURF_DIST, break; else t += dist; if t > MAX_DIST break.

At end, if hit: compute normal, shading.

Map function: compute SDF of metaballs. We'll implement 8 metaballs with positions computed each frame: `pos[i] = vec3(sin(iTime + offset), cos(iTime + offset), sin(iTime*0.5 + offset));` Use offsets per ball: e.g., `vec3 offset = vec3(i * 1.5, i * 0.9, i * 0.7);`. Radii: `float r = 0.5 + 0.2*sin(iTime + offset.x);` but we can just use constant radii.

Simpler: we can compute positions and radii inside map function: e.g., `float r = 0.4;` `float k = 0.5;` For i from 0 to 7: `vec3 p_i = vec3(sin(iTime + float(i)*3.14/4.0)*1.0, cos(iTime + float(i)*3.14/4.0)*1.0, sin(iTime*0.5+float(i)*3.14/4.0));` Then compute sphere SDF at p-p_i. Combine.

But we want to avoid loops in GLSL for performance? We can use loops; but we can unroll loops manually for 8 balls. But we can also use loops with constant size. It's fine.

But we cannot use `for` loops with dynamic count? We can use `for(int i=0; i<8; ++i)`; but we need to unroll manually? For WebGL1, loops with constant iteration counts are allowed. We'll use 8.

Define `float k = 0.5;` for smooth min.

Implementation of smin: `float smin(float a, float b, float k) { float h = clamp(0.5 + 0.5*(b-a)/k, 0.0, 1.0); return mix(b, a, h) - k*h*(1.0-h); }` But simpler: `float smin(float a, float b, float k) { float res = -log(exp(-k*a)+exp(-k*b))/k; return res; }` Use `exp`, `log`. That's fine.

But we need to ensure we don't get negative inside log. For negative distances, it's fine because we are only using distances > 0? Actually distances can be negative for points inside the sphere; but we can still compute log of negative? That would be NaN. So we should use the function only for positive distances or handle negative values. But the smooth min formula may produce negative values. But we can compute with `exp(-k*a)` where a may be negative; exp(-k*a) is fine. But log of sum of exponentials: `exp(-k*a)` may be large if a negative; but log of large positive number is fine. So no problem. But we must compute `-log(...) / k;` which will be negative for negative distances. That's fine.

So we can use the log formula.

Now, implement `map(p)`: compute `float d = length(p - vec3(0.0,0.0,0.0)) - r0;` then combine with others.

But we want to compute positions relative to camera? We'll compute positions relative to world origin: we want to move them around.

Positions: For each ball i: compute offset = vec3(sin(iTime + float(i)*2.0), cos(iTime + float(i)*2.0), sin(iTime*0.5 + float(i)*2.0)). Multiply by scale: e.g., 1.5. So `vec3 center = offset*1.5;` radius: `float rad = 0.4 + 0.2*sin(iTime + float(i));`.

Map: `float d = sdSphere(p - center, rad);` Then combine.

But we also want to rotate the entire arrangement? Not necessary.

Now shading: Use normal and light.

Compute color: Use HSL to RGB: we can implement `vec3 hsl2rgb(vec3 hsl)`.

But we can also use simpler: compute `col = vec3(0.5 + 0.5*cos(6.28318*(vec3(1.0, 1.7, 2.0)*p + iTime));` This yields swirling color.

Alternatively, we can compute base color from distance: `float intensity = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(10.0 * dist + iTime);` But we need to compute color after hit.

Simpler: `vec3 col = vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) * diff;` Then add glow: `col += vec3(1.0) * pow(diff, 4.0);` Then modulate with swirling color: `col *= vec3(0.5 + 0.5*sin(iTime + p.xyx*3.0));` That may produce psychedelic.

Ok.

Now implement code.

Also we need to set uniform resolution: `gl.uniform2f(uResolutionLocation, canvas.width, canvas.height);` And update time: `gl.uniform1f(uTimeLocation, time);` Use requestAnimationFrame.

Also we need to handle canvas resizing: set canvas width/height to window.innerWidth, etc. On resize, update canvas size and uniform.

Also we need to compile shaders: standard.

Now produce final HTML.

Let's craft the final answer.

We'll produce a single HTML file with script tags for shaders and JavaScript. Provide explanation in comments.

Let's write the code:

But we need to ensure HSL to RGB function not used? It's defined but not used; we can remove or use. But we can keep.

But we used `hsl2rgb` but not used; we can remove or use. But it's fine.

We need to ensure we included `gl_FragColor` or `out vec4 fragColor` depending on WebGL1 vs WebGL2. We used `gl_FragColor` which is fine for WebGL1.

But we used `vec3 base = vec3( 0.5 + 0.5*sin(...), ... )` but we used 3 separate sin for each component; but we used `vec3(..., ..., ...)` incorrectly? We wrote:

```
vec3 base = vec3(
    0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos.xyx*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0)),
    0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos.yzx*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0)),
    0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos.zxy*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0))
);
```

But `vec3()` expects 3 arguments; each argument is a float. But we passed vec3 to each argument; not good. Should compute each component separately: e.g.,

```
vec3 base;
base.r = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos.x*3.0 + 0.0);
base.g = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos.y*3.0 + 2.0);
base.b = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos.z*3.0 + 4.0);
```

Simplify: `vec3 base = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0));` That works: each component computed.

Let's update that.

Also we used `pos.xyx` etc; not needed. We'll just use `pos*3.0`.

Ok.

Also we used `vec3 base = vec3(...)` but we used `base.r` etc; but we can just compute `vec3 base = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos*3.0 + vec3(0.0, 2.0, 4.0));`.

Also we used `spec` but we didn't use spec? We used `col += vec3(1.0) * spec * 0.6;` That's fine.

Also we used `col` might exceed 1; we gamma-correct.

Also we used `pow(col, vec3(0.4545));` good.

Also we used `vec3 lightDir = normalize(vec3(0.5,0.8,0.3));` Good.

Now check shader: we used `map` inside getNormal; but we used `map` again; we defined map function before getNormal; yes.

But we used `map` inside getNormal; we used `map(p + vec3(eps,0,0))` etc; good.

Now we used `float d = 1e5;` initial value; then we combine with first sphere? Actually we combine each sphere with smin; but we need to start with large value so that smin(d, dS) returns dS for first sphere. Good.

Now we used `float d = 1e5;` but we didn't combine after first sphere: we did `d = smin(d, dS, k);` So for first sphere, dS will be min with large d => dS.

Now we used `float k = 0.5;` smoothing factor. Good.

Now we used `for(int i=0; i<N; ++i)`. This is allowed because N constant. Good.

Now we used `vec3 c = vec3(sin(t)*1.5, cos(t)*1.5, sin(t*0.5 + float(i))*1.5);` This gives positions.

Now we used `float r = 0.4 + 0.15*sin(t + float(i));` Good.

Now we used `float dS = sdSphere(p - c, r);` Good.

Now we used `d = smin(d, dS, k);` Good.

Now we used `map` returns d.

Now we used `rayDir = normalize(vec3(p,1.0));` Good.

Now we used `vec3 camPos = vec3(0,0,-4);` Good.

Now we used `float t = 0.0;` Good.

Now we used `for(int i=0;i<MAX_STEPS;++i)`; good.

Now we used `if(dist < SURF_DIST) { hit=true; break; }` Good.

Now we used `if(t > MAX_DIST) break;` Good.

Now we used `t += dist;` Good.

Now we used `pos = camPos + t * rayDir;` Good.

Now we used `normal = getNormal(pos);`

Now we used `float diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);` Good.

Now we used `float spec = pow(max(dot(reflect(-lightDir, normal), -rayDir), 0.0), 32.0);` Good.

Now we used `vec3 base = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0));` Good.

Now we used `col = base * diff;` Good.

Now we used `col += vec3(1.0) * spec * 0.6;` Good.

Now we used `col = pow(col, vec3(0.4545));` Good.

Now we used `gl_FragColor = vec4(col,1.0);` Good.

Now background: `col = vec3(0.0,0.0,0.0);` Good.

Now we didn't use `hsl2rgb`; we can remove.

But we might want to incorporate `hsl2rgb` to produce more psychedelic effect; but we can keep not used; it's fine.

Now we need to ensure we include `precision highp float;` at top of fragment shader. Good.

Now we need to ensure we include `uniform float uTime; uniform vec2 uResolution;` Good.

Now we need to ensure vertex shader passes `vUV` properly; we map from [-1,1] to [0,1]. Good.

Now we need to ensure we set the attribute `aPosition`. Good.

Now we need to ensure we set `gl_FragColor` for WebGL1; yes.

Now we need to ensure we set the canvas size and viewport; we did.

Now we need to ensure we call `gl.clearColor(0,0,0,1); gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);` Good.

Now we need to ensure we call `gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 6);` Good.

Now we need to ensure we call `requestAnimationFrame(render);` Good.

Now we need to ensure we update time uniform each frame; we did.

Now we need to ensure we use `performance.now()` for high precision.

Now we need to ensure we handle resizing; we did.

Now we need to ensure we set `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` correctly; we did.

Now we need to ensure we compile shader and program; we did.

Now we need to ensure we handle errors.

Now we need to ensure we have the correct `<script>` tags for shaders; we did.

Now we need to ensure we have the correct `type="x-shader/x-vertex"` etc; we did.

Now we need to ensure we have the correct `<canvas>` id; we did.

Now we need to ensure we set `gl.useProgram(program);` after linking; yes.

Now we need to ensure we create `vbo` and set up attributes; we did.

Now we need to ensure we set `gl.enableVertexAttribArray(aPosLoc);` etc; yes.

Now we need to ensure we set `gl.vertexAttribPointer(aPosLoc, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);` Good.

Now we need to ensure we have a global variable `startTime` used for elapsed; we did.

Now we need to ensure we call `render` inside `requestAnimationFrame`; we did.

Now we need to ensure we call `resize` on window load; we did.

Now we need to ensure we don't have stray semicolons or errors.

Now we need to ensure we are using `vec3` etc; yes.

Now we need to ensure we don't use `hsl2rgb` function; it's defined but not used; we might remove or keep. It's fine.

Now we need to ensure we didn't use `vec3 base = vec3(...)` incorrectly; we changed to `vec3 base = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0));`. Let's update.

Now we also need to ensure we didn't use `vec3 base = vec3(...)` earlier; we replaced.

Now we might want to test for missing semicolons. The code appears fine.

Now we might want to test for mismatched parentheses. Let's quickly parse:

- In fragment shader:

```
precision highp float;
uniform float uTime;
uniform vec2 uResolution;
varying vec2 vUV;

// Signed distance to sphere
float sdSphere(vec3 p, float r) {
    return length(p) - r;
}

// Smooth minimum (log-exp)
float smin(float a, float b, float k) {
    return -log(exp(-k*a)+exp(-k*b))/k;
}

// Map function: distance from point to metaball field
float map(vec3 p) {
    float d = 1e5; // large initial value
    // Parameters
    const int N = 8;
    const float k = 0.5; // smoothing factor

    for(int i=0; i<N; ++i) {
        float t = uTime + float(i)*2.0;
        vec3 c = vec3(
            sin(t)*1.5,
            cos(t)*1.5,
            sin(t*0.5 + float(i))*1.5
        );
        float r = 0.4 + 0.15*sin(t + float(i));
        float dS = sdSphere(p - c, r);
        d = smin(d, dS, k);
    }
    return d;
}

// Approximate normal via central differences
vec3 getNormal(vec3 p) {
    const float eps = 0.001;
    float dx = map(p + vec3(eps,0,0)) - map(p - vec3(eps,0,0));
    float dy = map(p + vec3(0,eps,0)) - map(p - vec3(0,eps,0));
    float dz = map(p + vec3(0,0,eps)) - map(p - vec3(0,0,eps));
    return normalize(vec3(dx,dy,dz));
}

// Convert HSL to RGB
vec3 hsl2rgb(vec3 hsl) {
    vec3 rgb = clamp( abs(mod(hsl.x*6.0 + vec3(0.0,4.0,2.0), 6.0)-3.0)-1.0, 0.0, 1.0 );
    return hsl.z + hsl.y * (rgb - 0.5) * (1.0 - abs(2.0*hsl.z - 1.0));
}

// Main fragment
void main() {
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = vUV;
    // Map to [-1,1] with correct aspect
    vec2 p = uv * 2.0 - 1.0;
    p.x *= uResolution.x / uResolution.y;

    // Camera setup
    vec3 camPos = vec3(0.0, 0.0, -4.0);
    vec3 rayDir = normalize(vec3(p, 1.0));

    // Ray march
    float t = 0.0;
    const int MAX_STEPS = 128;
    const float MAX_DIST = 100.0;
    const float SURF_DIST = 0.002;
    float dist = 0.0;
    bool hit = false;

    for(int i=0; i<MAX_STEPS; ++i) {
        vec3 pos = camPos + t * rayDir;
        dist = map(pos);
        if(dist < SURF_DIST) {
            hit = true;
            break;
        }
        if(t > MAX_DIST) break;
        t += dist;
    }

    vec3 col;
    if(hit) {
        vec3 pos = camPos + t * rayDir;
        vec3 normal = getNormal(pos);

        // Simple lighting
        vec3 lightDir = normalize(vec3(0.5, 0.8, 0.3));
        float diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);
        float spec = pow(max(dot(reflect(-lightDir, normal), -rayDir), 0.0), 32.0);

        // Color based on position and time for psychedelic effect
        vec3 base = 0.5 + 0.5*sin(uTime + pos*3.0 + vec3(0.0,2.0,4.0));
        col = base * diff;
        col += vec3(1.0) * spec * 0.6;
    } else {
        // Background gradient
        col = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    }

    // Gamma correct
    col = pow(col, vec3(0.4545));
    gl_FragColor = vec4(col, 1.0);
}
```

All semicolons present.

Now we need to ensure we didn't have stray `)` or `}` mismatched.

The vertex shader:

```
attribute vec2 aPosition;
varying vec2 vUV;
void main() {
    vUV = aPosition * 0.5 + 0.5;
    gl_Position = vec4(aPosition, 0.0, 1.0);

Ok.

Now we can produce final answer: the full HTML file with all code.

But we also need to provide explanation or notes? The deliverable says: Provide the complete solution within a single HTML file, including JavaScript for WebGL setup/uniform updates and the GLSL code for the vertex and fragment shaders (e.g., within `<script>` tags with types like `x-shader/x-vertex`). We may add notes.

So we should produce final HTML file with all code.

But we might also want to add some notes in the `<section id="notes">` about implementation.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.

But we must ensure the final output is a single HTML file with all code.

Also, we may want to add the `x-shader/x-vertex` and `x-shader/x-fragment` tags; we did.

Now we need to ensure we didn't miss closing tags.

Let's produce final answer.

<!-- Optional notes about the implementation -->
<section id="notes">
    <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eight metaballs are generated procedurally in the fragment shader.  
            Their centres move on circular orbits and their radii pulse with a
            sine function.  This keeps the demo fully autonomous – no data
            needs to be sent from JavaScript after the initial uniforms.</li>
        <li>The scene SDF is built by repeatedly applying a smooth minimum
            (log‑exp) to all sphere distances.  This produces the classic
            “soft‑union” effect where spheres merge into a single organic
            shape.</li>
        <li>Ray marching uses a simple distance‑to‑surface heuristic.  The
            loop stops when the distance is below a small epsilon or when
            a maximum distance is exceeded.</li>
        <li>Lighting is a minimal Phong model.  The colour of each hit is
            modulated by a time‑varying sine pattern that gives the
            psychedelic feel.</li>
        <li>All calculations are performed in the fragment shader – the
            vertex shader is just a pass‑through that draws a full‑screen
            quad.</li>
